  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The RTE library is a frontend or wrapper of other libraries or programs
  for real time video and audio compression on Linux. Currently it works
  on x86 CPUs only, sorry. The library is designed to interface between
  codecs and the Zapping TV viewer: http://zapping.sourceforge.net,
  precisely its recording plugin.

  For details on using the library see the documentation in doc/html (built
  only if you have Doxygen) and the files in the test directory. Note until
  a regular release the API is subject to change.

  Installation
  ============

  To build and install RTE type "./configure" and "make install". For
  additional instructions see the INSTALL file.

  If you got this source from the Zapping CVS repository it can (for now)
  also build the mp1e program. To do this change into the mp1e subdirectory
  and follow the build instructions there instead. The complete ffmpeg
  program is available from http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net.

  You cannot build rte and mp1e in the same source tree. When you built
  already and now reconfigure for the other target you should issue a
  "make clean". You can however create separate build directories and
  configure from there: cd <elsewhere>; <here>/configure or
  <here>/mp1e/configure; make.

  The autogen.sh script bootstraps all configuration scripts and
  Makefile.ins. No need to run it unless you changed configure.in
  or Makefile.am files, the generated config files are in CVS now.

  Ideas, questions, patches and bug reports
  =========================================

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2599 or e-mail
  mailto:zapping-misc@lists.sourceforge.net, registration is not
  required. Please do not mail the ffmpeg list directly, they
  will not provide support for our copy of ffmpeg.
