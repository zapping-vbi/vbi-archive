librte 0.5.5, 2005-03-11
------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- librte breaks large files into smaller parts on systems which have a
  2 GB file size limit.  When the system reported a limit of 2^64-1 bytes
  it was incorrectly interpreted as -2^63.

librte 0.5.4, 2005-02-28
------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- The documentation was updated.
- make check was extended to test all valid combinations of codecs and
  file formats (and some invalid combinations which did not fail as
  expected).
- src/Makefile required libiconv even if iconv is part of
  libc. (Possibly introduced in unreleased version 0.5.3.)
- Various constructs gcc 4.x frowns upon or even rejects were
  corrected.
- The AC3 codec segfaulted on FreeBSD due to a stack overflow.
- Some error checks resulted in a segfault due to wrong/missing
  printf() parameters.
- The mp1e VCD multiplexer segfaulted at stream end due to a timestamp
  overflow in the stream scheduling algorithm.
- The mp1e MPEG-1 and -2 codec segfaulted on FreeBSD after improperly
  freeing aligned memory.

0.5.2
-----
Fixes bug #872742 "doesnt compile with divx4linux-20030428", and
ffmpeg color bug.

0.5.1
-----
Bug fixes. This version compiles and runs (or so it seems) on FreeBSD 4.6,
except for the DivX4Linux interface, naturally.
