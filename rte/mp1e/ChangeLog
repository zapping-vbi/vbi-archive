	* configure.in: Prepared for automake 1.6.
	* Automake.am: Removed global_data.c from libmp1e_la_SOURCES,
	  1.6 doesn't like it and it's no longer needed anyway.
	* b_mp1e.c: Added mux thread, seems to work.
	  More tests required.

2002-03-16	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* b_mp1e.c: Added mux i/o, untested.

2002-03-14	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	  -X etc accepted out of bounds values.
	* audio/mp2.c: fixed option_get(num_frames) bug,
	  num_frames = INT_MAX ~ oo.
	* video/mpeg1.c: num_frames = INT_MAX ~ oo.

2002-02-18	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Improved timestamping in audio&video interfaces.
	* audio/mp2.c: Fixed audio frame dropping bug.
	* audio/arts.c: Added, ported from Zapping. (Just for
	  completeness, stinks no less than the ESD interface.)

2002-01-13	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* test/preview.c: Restored.
	* video/mpeg1.c: Fixed bug in frame skipping code. 

2001-12-11	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

2001-11-28	Multiplexer fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* systems/mpeg1.c, mpeg2.c, vcd.c: Fixed I picture PTS reorder
	  offset bug, created incorrect I PTS when encoding B frames
	  (not in 1.9.1).
	* -e0: Fixed incorrect P picture offset.
	* -e1: Fake B picture PTS not coded anymore, fixed incorrect
	  I/P PTS offset in video/mpeg1.c.
	* -e2: worked. :-)

2001-11-27	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* v4l.c: Try VIDEO_PALETTE_YUYV before _YUV422. (Some drivers
	  do not support _YUYV, and YUV422 may be YUYV (bttv), UYVY
	  (dc10) or according to v4l api spec YYYYUUVV.)
	* psycho.c: Fixed array initialization, segfault was possible.

2001-11-20	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* motion.c fix: ignored result 2nd of (0,0) test (rare, not critical).

2001-11-01	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* mp2.c: Fixed audio table selection (wrong sampling_freq).
	* oss.c: Mixer always set volume of line, not requested source.
	* main.c: Added fallback for unsupported joint stereo.
	* mp1e.1: Corrected a few typos.

2001-10-23	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* mp2.c: Improved the codec status stuff, moved the sample
	  parameters code.
	* systems.c: Made buffer allocation in add_input_stream
	  optional to clean up init() in mp2.c.
	* b_mp1e.c: Added format enumeration code, unfinished.

2001-10-21	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* video/mpeg1.c: Fixed incorrect type of bit_rate, strdup(0)
	  in option_print, virtual > coded_frame_rate bug.
	* audio/mp2.c: mpeg1_mp2_thread -> class.mainloop. 

2001-10-18	<mschimek@users.sf.net>
	
	* esd.c: Replaced timestamping code by the v4l type, should
	  better handle audio dropping.
	* oss.c: Accept other formats than S16LE.

2001-10-17	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* oss.c: Fixed sampling_freq check, reported by Ralf Oehler.

	* added rte_parameters and status.

2001-10-01	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	  09-20. Still not what I'd like, but hopefully sufficient.
	* mpeg1.c: Rewrote frame dropping/skipping code, added rte
	  options, lots of small changes.

2001-09-28	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* v4l2.c: Added Steven Davies' bttv 0.8 v4l2 r/w patch.

2001-09-25	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* video: Some work towards reentrancy and encapsulation.
	* mp2.c: Added S|U8|16LE sample conversion.
	* alsa.c: Added new direct, mmapping interface. Let's see
	  if this works better.

2001-09-23	finished rte audio options <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Moved rte_option stuff from b_mp1e.c to mp2.c, added get_option.
	* Made audio reentrant, unlimited number of mp2 streams, prefixed
	  local functions, all tests compiled in.
	* Changed mp1e frontend to use rte codec interface for audio.

2001-09-20	audio clock drift extravaganza <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* oss.c: Found a timestamp bug (ispace sign, code obsolete), audio
	  data wrap-around code removed, timestamping rewritten from scratch,
	  explict allocation of DMA fragments, OSS optional.
	* alsa.c: Replaced audio data wrap-around by flat buffer code, added
	  timestamp low-pass, added ALSA-0.9 interface (preliminary, is
	  untested and needs better time stamping), both optional.
	* esd.c: Replaced audio data wrap-around by flat buffer code, added
	  timestamp low-pass (more a protection for the clock drift algo,
	  there's no good method to avoid a constant lag caused by esd
	  overhead, if any).
	* afl.c: Replaced audio data wrap-around by flat buffer code,
	  fixed sampling rate bug introduced 2001-07-27, AFL wasn't
	  mentioned in the man page although available in earlier versions.
	* mp2.c: Bug in audio sync code (obsolete), rewrote sampling
	  device interface from scratch, removed zero-copy option, added
	  clock drift compensation code.
	* sync.c: Extended sync_break for clock drift compensation.
	* configure.in: New alsalib test, driver interface summary.
	* v4l.c: Added timestamp low-pass (esd.c comment applies).

2001-09-13	user data to mux_alloc <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* systems: pass down user_data to mux_output, needed for getting
	rid of rte_global_context.

2001-09-12	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Made the initial audio sync sample accurate (admit that's a bit
	  overkill) and fixed a minor bug in sync.c.

2001-09-07	audio noise bug <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* afl.c, alsa.c, esd.c: Fixed an internal interface bug.
	* global_data.c: PCM device didn't default to ALSA if present.
	* options.c: Cleaned up usage text.

2001-09-03	audio sync hang fix <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* sync.c: Added bytes_per_sample parameter, for (;;) aborts
	  after two seconds.
	* audio.c: Pass source, not dest frame rate to sync(),
	  follow-up to relaxing the input buffer size.

2001-09-01	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Added create_links(), debugging option, mmxemu test.
	* main.c: Uses mmxemu if available for debugging.

2001-08-29	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* video/filter.c: init_filter looked suspicious, rewrote.
	* b_mp1e.c: Added image size error check.
	* mpeg1.c: Fixed "dnl gcc3 -O0 makes mmx_mbsum segv, why?". Stupid me.

2001-08-27	post-release fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Temporary change of the alsa test due to 0.9
	  incompatibility.
	* global_data.c: Back to default -F1, was a bad idea apparently.

2001-08-19	rte fix <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* mp1e_b.c didn't select a multiplexer, static default mpeg1-ps,
	  set to elementary when only one stream present for mp1e cli compat.
	* Improved checks in multiplexers.
	* Cloned AC_CHECK_FUNCS(program_invocation_name) from Zapping.

2001-08-10	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Managed to confuse Intel and AT&T syntax in motion.c only
	  newer 'as' would understand. Converted to AT&T.
	* video/v4l.c: Didn't work, rewrote, let's see.

2001-08-08	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* New mux context. (Wanted to replace output stuff but that
	  needs more preparation.)

2001-08-06	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* ffmpeg: crash due to cpuid bug, updated from ffmpeg cvs.
	* rte/b_mp1e: report audio frame count in audio only mode.
	* b_mp1e: increased audio buffer size to 8 * frame size (similar
	  to mp1e btw.), hope this gives better sync w/esd. Data is more
	  likely new when we read/stamp because encoding is much faster
	  than input, although still far from reliable synching.
	* rte: fixed a typo in destroy sequence causing hangs.
	* mp1e video: missing eof reply.

2001-08-01	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* ffmpeg/: Added ffmpeg backend, taken from ffmpeg cvs
	(http://ffmpeg.sf.net). Needs a lot of work, but most modes
	already encode.

2001-08-01	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* video/mpeg1.c: Fixed fifo eof handling.
	* Restored preview, preliminary.
	* Examined the 2001-06-07 bug, is a DC rounding problem,
	  not strictly a bug. Modified the quant calculation.
	  Lets see how that works, then optimize.
	* Restored v4l interface.

2001-07-31	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added optional input fifo wrapper to mp2 encoder.

2001-07-28	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Converted remaining fifos to fifo2.

2001-07-27	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Converted capture fifos to fifo2 in mp1e and rte.
	* Configure checks whether as supports SSE2.

2001-07-18	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Rewrote bstream function
	* Several fixes and improvements in emu
	* Added SSE2 support

	* Added SSE and 3DNow! support

2001-07-06	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Made ioctls EINTR aware
	* Corrected a B quant typo (post 1.9pre1)
	* Added motion option to rte

2001-07-05	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed global vbuf conflict in rte_test, same correction
	  in video/v4l2.c, just in case

2001-07-02	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added man page

2001-06-22	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	- MC + 704x576 -> segv
	  2001-07-05 can't reproduce
	* gcc 3.0 fixes

2001-06-07	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Restored subtitle recording
	- MC P/B bug still with us :-P

2001-06-05	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Removed all hardcoded image sizes from motion code
	* Some cleanup in motion.c
	* Integration of motion finished (not enabled by default)

2001-06-04	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed B-frame VLC bug
	* Fixed B-motion mb skipping bug
	* Fixed B-motion PMV bug
	* Fixed MV overflow bug (could be improved)

2001-06-01	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Rewrote configure.in; added config.h
	* Fixed closed_gop B-motion bug
	* Integrating motion, unfinished

2001-05-27	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed rte buffered push capture, removed the possibility of
	deadlock in kill_zombies (the solution isn't optimal,
	though). rte_test works now with all possible combinations for me.
	* YVU support.

2001-05-10	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* Added .spec.in file, mux_thread_done flag for cleaner exit, some
	more fixes to rte/fifos. Lots of useless debugging of mpeg plugin
	segfaults/hanging, cannot isolate the bug yet.

2001-05-07	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added MC 3.1, not yet compiled in by default, needs testing.
	- MC: stream syntax bug, probably large vectors
	  [-> confirmed, fixed on 2001-06-04]
	- With MC enabled: P/B block bug (quant?), apparently at scene cuts

2001-05-06	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* more work on fifos (killing zombies, fixes). Still some bugs
	left.
	* (later) fixed a couple of bugs, plus a purely theoretical one.

2001-04-12	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed p-frame skipped mb bug.
