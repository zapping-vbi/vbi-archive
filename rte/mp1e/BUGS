	 Bad grouping code for samples [ch][sb][s(+0,1,2)]

		Code of grouped samples #s,#s+1,#s+2 in
		subband #sb in channel #ch is violating 
		unequalities in part C1528 ISO/IEC 11172-3
		and part 2533 ISO/IEC 11172-4 (layer 2 only)

	 Bad code for samples [ch][sb][s]

		Code of sample #s in subband #sb in channel
		#ch has all its bits equal to 1, violating
		part C1528 ISO/IEC 11172-3 and part 2533
		ISO/IEC 11172-4 if layer is 2, violating
		part C1517 ISO/IEC 11172-3 and part 2532
		ISO/IEC 11172-4 if layer is 1.

	 Scalefactor [ch][sb][n]

		Scalefactor #n in subband #sb in channel
		#ch has all its bits equal to 1, violating
		Table B.1 of ISO/IEC 11172-3 and part 2533
		ISO/IEC 11172-4 (part 2532 if layer is 1).

	 Too many data expected

		The bit allocation is such that the total
		number of bits expected exceeds the frame
		lenght, violating part 2533 of ISO/IEC
		11172-4 (part 2532 if layer is 1)

	 Wrong padding bit compliance

		The following unequality is not checked:
		-N+file_length
			<accumulated_length
				<N+file_length
		N is 8 bits for layer 2, 32 for layer 1.
		accumulated_length is defined in part 2423
		of ISO/IEC 11172-3. Please note that ISO is
		more restrictive when the file is not
		extracted from a longer sequence.

	 All numbers (n,s,ch,sb) start from 0, like in
	 part 2415 of ISO/IEC 11172-3

 In frame 0++ :
	Bitrate incompatible with mode non mono

 Playback passed.
