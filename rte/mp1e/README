  MP1E - Real Time Software MPEG-1 Encoder for Linux

  Installation
  ============

  When you got mp1e from cvs, type "./autogen.sh" to create
  and run the configure script. You will need recent versions
  of the GNU build utilities automake, autoconf etc.
  
  When the source comes from a .tgz or .rpm package, just
  type "./configure".

  You can preset the CFLAGS environment variable. This is
  useful to optimize a little more, or to pass compiler flags
  like -g to aid debugging (see info gcc for more). Example:

    CFLAGS="-mcpu=athlon-xp" ./configure

  Finally type "make install".

  For usage instructions see the mp1e manual page: "man mp1e".
