  MP1E - Real Time Software MPEG-1 Encoder for Linux

  Installation
  ============

  When you got mp1e from cvs, type "./autogen.sh" in the
  parent rte/ directory, then cd into mp1e/ and proceed as follows.

  When the source comes from a .tgz or .rpm package, just
  type "./configure".

  As "./configure --help" elaborates, you can preset the CFLAGS
  environment variable. This is useful to pass compiler flags
  for debugging or CPU specific optimization. See info gcc for
  more. Example: CFLAGS="-mcpu=athlon-xp" ./configure

  Finally type "make install".

  For usage instructions see the mp1e manual page: "man mp1e".
