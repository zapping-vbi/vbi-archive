<p>
With "video4linux" drivers only one application at a time can capture
VBI data. The 2nd generation "v4l2" API allows multiple clients to open
a device, but still only one client may read from the device. If for
example the <a href="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/">Nxtvepg</a>
daemon runs in the background users will not be able to start a
Teletext application. The VBI proxy was developed as a solution to this
problem.
</p><p>
VBI can transport many independent data streams: VPS, WSS, Closed
Caption and Teletext, within them PDC, XDS and custom data streams
providing such services as Teletext, subtitles, caption, NexTView and
other Electronic Programme Guides, channel identification, video
recording triggers, information about the current program, wide screen
signalling and more.  We want to share one VBI stream between for
example an application opening the device to update the system clock,
Teletext viewers, TV viewers displaying channel names, caption or
subtitles, recording applications, a PVR watching channels for
recording triggers, and an EPG daemon updating its database.
</p><p>The proxy must assign higher priority to recording and lower
priority to background applications. It must coordinate channel changes
between background "data harvesting" applications. Such apps would
register a channel request with the proxy together with a priority and
expected time of use and the proxy will then grant those requests
according to priority and previous grants in a round-robin way.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="How_does_it_work"></a>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
The VBI proxy is implemented as a daemon <code>zvbid</code>, which
usually will be started during system boot. The daemon remains dormant
until the first proxy client connects through a socket, then opens the
VBI device and starts capturing and decoding the services requested by
the client, e.g. Teletext. It will not pass raw but sliced VBI data,
reducing the required bandwidth and saving repeated decoding of data
needed by multiple clients. </p><p>
One drawback of this solution is that clients must be adapted, i.e.
instead of opening the VBI device as usual, clients have to connect to
the daemon (but if the daemon is not running they should fall back to
using the device directly). For most applications already using libzvbi
the change is minimal: A single function call is enough to create a
proxy client and connect to the server, another to start capturing. The
API to capture and decode services is identical for v4l2, v4l, bktr,
dvb and proxy devices. Legacy applications can often be ported simply
by replacing open and read system calls with their libzvbi equivalents.
</p><p>
As a work-around for applications which cannot be adapted, a wrapper <code>zvbi-chains</code>
is available which intercepts access to the VBI device and redirects it
to the proxy. In this case however only raw VBI data can be
forwarded, resulting in a significantly higher CPU load.
</p><p>Hopefully the solution is elegant enough to convince the
authors to invest the necessary effort to switch to libzvbi (or at
least implement the proxy protocol) in subsequent releases of their
software.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="Current_status"></a>Current status</h2>
<p>The proxy may still need improvement, see below for a detailed list
of open points, but at least the basic service works well, and the API
will remain backwards compatible. Some applications using the proxy:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> The libzvbi test directory contains a small program <code>proxy-test</code> which can read and dump Teletext and VPS data from the proxy.  Try -help for a list of options.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The <a href="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/">Nxtevpg EPG
viewer</a> uses the proxy when compiled with -DUSE_LIBZVBI in the Makefile.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The <a href="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/">Zapping 0.8 TV viewer and Teletext browser</a> has basic proxy support and will use the proxy automatically when installed and running.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> The AleVT 1.6.1 Teletext browser and <a href="http://xawdecode.sourceforge.net/download/">Xawdecode TV viewer</a>
  use the proxy with patches from <a href="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/">http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/</a>:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/alevt-1.6.1-libzvbi.diff">http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/alevt-1.6.1-libzvbi.diff</a>
</li>
<li> <a href="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/alevtd-3.91-vbiproxy.diff">http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/alevtd-3.91-vbiproxy.diff</a>
</li>
<li> AleVT is also known to work unmodified with <code>zvbi-chains &lt;options&gt; alevt</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> The <a href="http://www.kdetv.org/">kdetv 0.8.5 TV viewer</a> includes proxy support.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With proxy you can run these applications (or multiple instances of
them, perhaps only pure VBI apps - YMMV) in parallel.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="To_do_list"></a>To-do list</h2>
<p>
This is an unordered list of open points (unimplemented or yet
undecided) regarding the proxy.  Any comments or help appreciated.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Optimize raw buffer forward, possibly based on shared memory to
avoid copying -&gt; requires user-space DMA in io-v4l2k (i.e. streaming
into buffers allocated by the user)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Device permissions are implemented by copying group id and access
mask of the device. This is not portable however according to man
socket(7). Possibly a sub-directory should be used and permissions set
on the directory. Disadvantage: other people cannot clean up (same for
socket file if sticky bit is set). Or an X11 way a key file could be
used.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Save errno upon device errors deep down, e.g. in proxy-msg.c into
io struct to make sure it's not overwritten higher up in the return
path
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Log daemon's errors and warnings in syslog (esp. protocol violations in clients, such as not returning token on request)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Channel change handling and scheduling not fully implemented yet; needs more testing
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Option: allow user to override or fine-tune channel priority requests (on side of daemon, based on client-names)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Inform clients about video norm changes: e.g. sampling rate may
change (only relevant for raw data though), frame rate changes -&gt;
must be considered when evaluating time stamps to detect dropped
frames; number of VBI lines may change, client may want to change
service IDs. Probably only for clients which explicitly enable this;
others could simply be starved.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> io-bktr.c not supported at all yet for new features. Note bktr is
weird(tm), for example one cannot capture VBI without video. The proxy
is not officially supported on FreeBSD.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Possibly add a generic capture client config function to:
<ul>
<li> Set video device path (v4l1 for channel changes &amp; norm query)
</li>
<li> Sequence counter instead of time stamp in vbi_capture_buffer (v4l1
bttv). Alternatively libzvbi 0.3 may provide sampling time and stream
time, the latter derived from sequence counters for analog devices.
</li>
<li> Query time between frames; query timestamp from driver or after read()
</li>
<li> Dynamically change buffer count (v4l2 only)
</li>
<li> optionally use read even if streaming is available
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Possible v4l2 API extensions:
<ul>
<li> Channel change event notification
</li>
<li> CGUNIT to check if two nodes refer to the same piece of hardware
</li>
<li> EIO from DQBUF: timeout, buffer must be requeued
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
