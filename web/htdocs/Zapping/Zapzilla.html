    <h1>Zapzilla</h1>

    <p>Zapzilla is the nickname of the Teletext browser built into
      Zapping. Here's a quick overview of its features:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Zapzilla implements the European Teletext standard
        (Teletext System B, EN 300 706).</li>
      <li>It can display Teletext Level 1/1.5/2.5/3.5 ("HiText")
        pages with 4096 colors, graphics, bold and italic
	characters, double width and/or height characters,
	concealed and flashing text.</li>
      <li>All Teletext character sets are supported, for example
        Turkish, Russian, Greek, Hebrew and Arabic. Users can
	override the character encoding, which isn't always
	correctly transmitted, and the selected encoding is saved
	across sessions.</li>
      <li>Zapzilla can show different pages in multiple windows.
        The main window can also display Teletext instead of video,
	either in a window, full-screen or as desktop background.</li>
      <li>The text brightness and contrast are adjustable.</li>
      <li>Zapzilla does not support custom fonts yet, but Teletext
        windows can assume any size and the page is scaled
	accordingly.</li>
      <li>Teletext pages can be overlaid onto video, e.g.
        subtitles, news flashes, or interactive pages.</li>
      <li>All displayed pages update in real time, for example the
        clock and "rolling" page number in the header.</li>
      <li>To change pages users can enter a page number, press
        cursor keys or click on toolbar buttons. Remote controls
	are also supported.</li>
      <li>Clicking on a page or subpage number in the text opens
        the page in the same or a new window. Like web browsers,
	Teletext windows have a forward, back and home button.</li>
      <li>Clicking on a URL in the text opens the page in a web
        browser. E-mail addresses open an e-mail client.</li>
      <li>TOP and FLOF navigation is supported. The TOP page index
        appears in a drop-down menu. TOP and FLOF links can be
	clicked on like page numbers. All pages of a channel are
	stored in memory for instant access.</li>
      <li>The Teletext cache can store pages of multiple channels
        to reduce wait times and to view pages of another channel
	than the one currently tuned in. The amount of memory
	consumed by Zapzilla is user definable.</li>
      <li>Users can search the Teletext cache, optionally using
        Unicode regular expressions. Currently this works with all
	character sets except Hebrew and Arabic, and on mixed
	language pages.</li>
      <li>Pages can be saved in HTML, PNG, PPM, and VTX format, or
        as plain text with or without colors.</li>
      <li>Users can mark text with the pointer and copy it into
        other applications, as text or image, with a middle mouse
	button click (drag & drop) or by pasting from the clipboard.
	Flowing (as in a web browser) and tabular text selection
	is possible.</li>
      <li>Pages can be bookmarked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Screenshots"></a> Screenshots</h3>

    <p>If you're not utterly impressed by now, here are the
    carefully crafted screenshots you've been waiting for. Note
    they were taken from version 0.6. The user interface changed
    completely in the meantime and I'm too busy to update this page.
    Donations welcome.</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/export.jpeg"><img
     class="floatright" src="/screenshots/ttx/export_s.jpeg" height=
    "300" width="400" /></a> OK, many things:</p>

    <p>There are three Teletext windows here, one of them is the
    Zapping main window acting as a Teletext viewer. You can see
    the graphics in the page. Note the arbitrary scaling, each
    Teletext page has a different size. The open dialog lets you
    export a page to the previously mentioned formats, here to an
    HTML page.</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/links.jpeg"><img
     class="floatleft" src="/screenshots/ttx/links_s.jpeg" height=
    "300" width="400" /></a> Apparently nothing special here, just
    Galeon and Zapzilla... until your neuronal network sees the
    pattern: "Perhaps the URL in Galeon has been opened by clicking
    on the link that appears in the Teletext page?". You are
    completely right, so I don't need to explain anything. I will
    just tell that email adresses and page numbers are clickable
    too. The cryptic message in the bottom row is part of the TOP
    navigation, also hyperlinks.</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/search.jpeg"><img
     class="floatright" src="/screenshots/ttx/search_s.jpeg" height=
    "300" width="400" /></a> Zapzilla supports searching for
    regular expressions in the page memory. I gave the
    <b>#email#</b> pattern to search for, the highlight text is the
    second match. The window in the back is the help window that
    appears when you click the "Help" button. And in case you are
    wondering, "<b>#email#</b>" isn't a regular expression, it's
    just a convenient alias I added that expands into one horrific
    expression like "<b>([:alnum:]|[-~.]+@([:alnum:]|[-~.])+)</b>".
    Basically it matches email adresses. Similarly you can use the
    "<b>#url#</b>" alias to match WWW addresses.</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/subtitles.jpeg">
    <img class="floatleft" src="/screenshots/ttx/subtitles_s.jpeg"
    height="300" width="400" /></a> This isn't properly Zapzilla,
    but the subtitle overlay built into Zapping in concert with the
    Closed Caption decoder built into libzvbi. Teletext subtitles
    are supported in the same way.</p>
