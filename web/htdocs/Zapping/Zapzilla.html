    <h1>Zapzilla</h1>

    <p>Zapzilla is the nickname of the Teletext browser built into
    Zapping. Some of its outstanding features are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Teletext Level 2.5/3.5 ("HiText") support, this includes: 

        <ul>
          <li>Support for all Teletext languages, for example
          Turkish, Russian, Greek, Hebrew and Arabic. Of course
          this extends to Teletext caption/subtitles.</li>

          <li>Support for <acronym title=
          "Dynamically Redefinable Character Set">DRCS</acronym>,
          permitting graphics in a Teletext page.</li>

          <li>4096 colors, new and enhanced text attributes, a
          larger character set, more font styles, ...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>TOP and FLOF navigation, all pages stored in memory for
      quick access.</li>

      <li>Arbitrary scaling and antialiasing of rendered
      pages.</li>

      <li>Regular expression Unicode searching in the page
      memory.</li>

      <li>Export to HTML, PNG, PPM, ASCII, ANSI, VTX.</li>

      <li>Wrapping and rectangular selection with middle mouse
      button and via clipboard.</li>

      <li>Bookmarks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Screenshots"></a> Screenshots</h3>

    <p>If you're not utterly impressed by now, here are the
    carefully crafted screenshots you've been waiting for. Note
    they were taken from version 0.6, the user interface changed a
    bit.</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/export.jpeg"><img
     class="floatright" src="/screenshots/ttx/export_s.jpeg" height=
    "300" width="400" /></a> OK, many things:</p>

    <p>There are three Teletext windows here, one of them is the
    Zapping main window acting as a Teletext viewer. You can see
    the graphics in the page. Note the arbitrary scaling, each
    Teletext page has a different size. The open dialog lets you
    export a page to the previously mentioned formats, here to an
    HTML page.</p>

    <p class="clear">&nbsp;</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/links.jpeg"><img
     class="floatleft" src="/screenshots/ttx/links_s.jpeg" height=
    "300" width="400" /></a> Apparently nothing special here, just
    Galeon and Zapzilla... until your neuronal network sees the
    pattern: "Perhaps the URL in Galeon has been opened by clicking
    on the link that appears in the Teletext page?". You are
    completely right, so I don't need to explain anything. I will
    just tell that email adresses and page numbers are clickable
    too. The cryptic message in the bottom row is part of the TOP
    navigation, also hyperlinks.</p>

    <p class="clear">&nbsp;</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/search.jpeg"><img
     class="floatright" src="/screenshots/ttx/search_s.jpeg" height=
    "300" width="400" /></a> Zapzilla supports searching for
    regular expressions in the page memory. I gave the
    <b>#email#</b> pattern to search for, the highlight text is the
    second match. The window in the back is the help window that
    appears when you click the "Help" button. And in case you are
    wondering, "<b>#email#</b>" isn't a regular expression, it's
    just a convenient alias I added that expands into one horrific
    expression like "<b>([:alnum:]|[-~.]+@([:alnum:]|[-~.])+)</b>".
    Basically it matches email adresses. Similarly you can use the
    "<b>#url#</b>" alias to match WWW addresses.</p>

    <p><a href="/screenshots/ttx/subtitles.jpeg">
    <img class="floatleft" src="/screenshots/ttx/subtitles_s.jpeg"
    height="300" width="400" /></a> This isn't properly Zapzilla,
    but the subtitle overlay built into Zapping in concert with the
    Closed Caption decoder built into libzvbi. Teletext subtitles
    are supported in the same way.</p>
