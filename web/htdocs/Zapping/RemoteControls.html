    <h1>Using a Remote Control</h1>

    <p>Zapping supports the LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control)
    infrastructure. Visit <a href="http://www.lirc.org/">http://www.lirc.org</a> for more information about LIRC.
    To use LIRC you must create a <code>.lircrc</code> file in your
    home directory. For each remote control button add an entry
    like these:</p>
<pre>
        begin
                prog   = zapping_lirc
                button = VOL_UP
                config = zapping.volume_incr(+5)
        end

        begin
                prog   = zapping_lirc
                button = 0
                config = SETCHANNEL 0
        end

        begin
                prog   = zapping_lirc
                button = 1
                config = SETCHANNEL 1
        end

        begin
                prog   = zapping_lirc
                button = 9
                config = SETCHANNEL 9
        end
</pre>

    <dl>
      <dt>prog</dt>

      <dd>is the program interpreting the command and must be
      <code>zapping_lirc</code>.</dd>

      <dt>button</dt>

      <dd>is the name of the remote control button. Presumably with
      LIRC you installed <code>/etc/lircd.conf</code>, this file
      lists all available buttons.</dd>

      <dt>config</dt>

      <dd>is a Zapping command. Commands are listed on the <a href=
      "/Zapping/ZappingCommands">Zapping Commands</a> page.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Suppose your remote control has a <code>TV/RADIO</code>
    button and you want to switch between two layers of commands,
    much like Shift Lock switches between lower and upper case
    characters. This can be accomplished by embracing the entries
    above within a <code>zapping_lirc</code> section, and
    programming the <code>TV/RADIO</code> button to enable this
    section, "switch to this mode" in LIRC speak.</p>
<pre>
begin zapping_lirc
        begin
                button = TV/RADIO
                mode   = radio
        end

        Zapping entries &hellip;
end zapping_lirc

begin radio
        begin
                button = TV/RADIO
                mode   = zapping_lirc
        end

        Other entries &hellip;
end radio

Mode-independend entries &hellip;
</pre>

    <p>Which mode will be initially selected? Well, none. But when
    you start Zapping it automatically switches to
    <code>zapping_lirc</code> mode, if such a section exists.</p>

    <p><img src="/images/warning.png" alt="Warning!"
    border="0" height="16" width="16" /> LIRC applications are
    supposed to cooperate by using <code>.lircrc</code>, but there
    is no way (or was, at the time the LIRC plugin was written) two
    applications can agree on the current mode, so they may both
    respond to a button press.</p>

    <p>For further instructions please see the LIRC
    documentation.</p>

    <h2><a name="Developer_Notes"></a> Developer Notes</h2>

    <p>Editing a config file isn't exactly what users of Gnome app
    should have to do. By default Zapping should find out which
    model of RC the user has and automatically assign actions to
    each button. If that's not possible it should prompt the user
    with a list of known models. In any case actions must be
    editable, and zapping should provide a GUI which lists all
    buttons and their current action. That being either a simple
    description like "Go to next channel" from a list or menu, or a
    Python command for experienced users.</p>

    <p><code>SETCHANNEL</code> is particularly odd. We take for
    granted that all keyboards send the same key codes, at least
    for the standard keys. Why can't LIRC do that? Life would be
    easier if Zapping could handle number keys collectively.</p>

    <p>Why do we have to store <em>our</em> configuration in
    <code>.lircrc</code> anyway? It would be easier to register
    modifiers like <code>TV/RADIO</code> with the lirc daemon, to
    synchronize clients, then filter button events and translate to
    actions ourselves.</p>

    <p>Another issue: buttons may change their function depending
    on the Zapping mode Video, Teletext, EPG, Recording etc.
    <code>SETCHANNEL</code> could change semantics, but in the long
    run we probably need more LIRC modes.</p>
