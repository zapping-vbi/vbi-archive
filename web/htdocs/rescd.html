<h1>ResCD</h1>
<div align="Justify">I wrote ResCD (Resident CD player) as a small but
 powerful TSR for
playing CD's in my old 486 using DOS.
The code is written
 completely for TASM 5.0 using my beloved <a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~sho/rho/rhide/rhide.html">rhide</a>
 and it works for MSDOS
6.2. It requires MSCDEX and HIMEM being installed.
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Highlights:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>It's a resident program, just load it in autoexec.bat and it will
be

 present during the entire DOS session.
</li>
  <li>Very easy usage:
    <ul>
      <li><b>F12</b>: Enters the text-mode interface with color menus,
playlist, etc.
</li>
      <li><b>F11</b>: Toggles secure mode.
</li>
      <li><b>F10</b>: Stop/Resume
</li>
      <li><b>F9</b>: Open/Close CD tray.
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Should work under all programs that don't alter the interrupt
table
 directly, but use the DOS ints instead. I.e., works under most
programs.
</li>
  <li>Uninstall it running `rescd' again.</li>
  <li>It's a good source for learning TASM (or 386 assembler in general)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>Lowlights:<br>
</b>
<ul>
  <li>It has stayed unmaintained for more than two years now.</li>
  <li>Some gross bugs:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It doesn't work under Win31</li>
    <li>Hangs if you open the interface (F12) and you don't do anything in
 a while.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>It's written in Spanish. Nevertheless, my brother has translated
 the GUI into English.</li>
</ul>
Anyway, I still use it regularly and find it very useful (and it was a great
 fun writing it :-).<br>
