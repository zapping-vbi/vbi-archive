<header>What to do if you find a bug</header>
    <p>If you have any problems, please leave a bug report in the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2599">Bug
    tracker</a> or send an e-mail to the project <a href=
    "http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/zapping-misc">mailing
    list</a>.</p>

    <p>It should include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A description of the symptoms</li>

      <li>How you triggered the bug</li>

      <li>Causalities you observe, for example when the bug
      manifests by switching to channel 13 on Fridays, but not on
      other weekdays</li>

      <li>When the problem is a program crash, more than the bare
        fact it is often useful to know <i>where</i> it happens.
	This information can be obtained with the GNU debugger,
	just type: 
<pre>
   you@yourbox&gt; gdb zapping
   gdb&gt; run [command line parameters, if any]
   -- crash --
   gdb&gt; bt
</pre>
        (this prints the chain of functions called) 
<pre>
   gdb&gt; quit
  
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <p>I cannot promise a quick fix in all cases, but your effort
    is greatly appreciated and resolving the problem has top
    priority.</p>
