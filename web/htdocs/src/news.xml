<header>Web page redesigned</header>
As you can see, the web page has been redesigned, it has new contents and
support for different themes (works best with cookies enabled). Thanks a lot to
<b>Carsten Menke</b>, he worked hard to create the excellent <i>Carsten</i>
theme. I hope you like the new design.
