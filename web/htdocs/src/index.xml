<header>What is Zapping?</header>

  Zapping is a TV viewer for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a>
  environment. It has some interesting features, namely:

  <ul>
    <li>It is for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a> /
      <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK</a>. This gives the program
      a very nice look, as you can see in the <a href=
      "screenshots.php">screenshots</a> page.</li>

    <li>It is based on plugins. This will make it easy to add
      functionality to the program, without making it hard to
      maintain, such as saving video as AVI/MPEG, viewing mirrored
      TV (scanning from right to left) or whatever you can imagine
      (and program).</li>

    <li>Has a very advanced builtin VBI decoder, description <a
      href="Zapzilla.html">here</a>.</li>

    <li>Lirc support.</li>

    <li>Realtime MPEG recording.</li>

    <li>And much more...</li>
  </ul>
