<header>Requirements for running Zapping</header>
<ul>
<li>V4L, V4L2 or XVideo support for your TV card</li>
<li>A working Gnome desktop, with the common libraries</li>
<li>libunicode version 0.4 or later</li>
<li>The remote control plugin (alirc incarnation) needs the LIRC (Linux
Infrared Remote Control) package. If not already part of your
distribution you can download LIRC from <a
href="http://www.lirc.org">http://www.lirc.org</a>.</li>
<li>The mpeg plugin needs the <b>rte library</b>, available from
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2599">
Zapping dowload page</a>. You need not download <b>mp1e</b> or <b>tveng</b>,
as these are already included in the rte library and Zapping, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<header>RPM packages</header>
The precompiled RPM packages I distribute are built in a SuSE 7.2 system with
all the extra packages installed. If you want to build your own packages, you
can run the script named '<i>prepare_dist.sh</i>' that comes with the zapping
source:<pre>
tar xvIf zapping.tar.bz2
cd zapping
./prepare_dist.sh
</pre>
I'm looking for volunteers to maintain packages for different distributions,
if you are interested, please <a href="mailto:garetxe@users.sf.net">mail
me</a>. Everything you need to do is to type the lines above and send me the
resulting package.
<p>
If some package dependency cannot be solved, a good way to install
the missing packages is to <a href="http://www.ximian.com/download/">
fetch</a> a <a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a> GNOME desktop.
If you have an RPM based distro, you can alternatively look for the
packages using <a href="http://www.rpmfind.net">RPMFIND</a>. Debian
users can get the debian packages from <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/graphics/zapping.html">testing</a>
and <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/zapping.html">unstable</a>,
both maintained by Christian Marillat.
</p>
<header>Compiling Zapping</header>
<p>
If you want to compile Zapping yourself, make sure you have the appropiate development
packages installed. For example, if compiling complains about AM_PATH_LIBGLADE,
make sure you have libglade-devel correctly installed.
</p>
<header>Downloading via HTTP</header>
<p>
You can download the latest version of Zapping from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zapping">SourceForge project page</a>,
or all files released by this project from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2599">dowload page</a>.
</p>
<p>Due to popular demand, the code interfacing with video capture drivers (V4L, V4L2
and XVideo) has been published as a separate package. The module called <b>tveng</b>
is also available from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zapping">project
page.</a> The realtime MPEG-1 encoder <b>mp1e</b> the rte library is based on, is
available as a stand-alone command line application from the same place.
</p>
<a name="CVS"></a>
<header>Downloading via CVS</header>
<p>
To get the latest development version of Zapping you can access the CVS server anonymously.
<b>Remember that there is no warranty that it will even compile.</b> This method is mainly
for developers and people that want to have the very latest, probably very buggy, and
occasionally heavily bugfixed, version. Enter the following:
<ol>
<li><pre>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.zapping.sf.net:/cvsroot/zapping login
</pre>You will be asked for a password, just hit return.
</li>
<li><pre>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.zapping.sf.net:/cvsroot/zapping co zapping</pre>
This will check out the latest version of Zapping (or "co rte" if you want),
from now on you can enter in your zapping (or rte) directory:
</li>
<li><pre>cvs -z3 update -dP</pre>
to update your local copy of the CVS repository.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
You can also <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/zapping">browse</a>
the CVS repository, or download this daily updated snapshot of the CVS tree <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/zapping-cvsroot.tar.gz">
zapping-cvsroot.tar.gz</a>. Caution: This contains the source and all changes
ever made, the file is very large.
