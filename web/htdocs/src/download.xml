<header>Requirements</header>
There are some requirements for running Zapping:
<ul>
<li>V4L, V4L2 or XVideo support for your card</li>
<li>A working Gnome desktop, with the common libraries</li>
<li>libunicode >= 0.4</li>
</ul>
The precompiled RPM packages I distribute are built in a SuSE 7.2 system with
all the extra packages installed. If you want to build your own packages, you
can run the script named '<i>prepare_dist.sh</i>' that comes with the zapping
source:<pre>
tar xvIf zapping.tar.bz2
cd zapping
./prepare_dist.sh
</pre>
I'm looking for volunteers to maintain packages for different distributions,
if you are interested, please <a href="mailto:garetxe@users.sf.net">mail
me</a>. Everything you need to do is to type the lines above and send me the
resulting package.
<p>
If you have some required dependency missing, a good way to install
them easily is getting a <a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a>
GNOME desktop, following <a
href="http://www.ximian.com/gethelix.php3">this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you have an RPM based distro, you can look for the
packages using <a href="http://www.rpmfind.net">RPMFIND</a>. Debian
users can get the debian packages from <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/graphics/zapping.html">testing</a>
and <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/zapping.html">unstable</a>,
both maintained by Christian Marillat.
</p>
<p>
If you want to compile it, make sure you have the appropiate development
packages installed. For example, if compiling complains about AM_PATH_LIBGLADE,
make sure you have libglade-devel correctly installed.
</p>
<p>
The remote control plugin (alirc incarnation) needs the LIRC (Linux
Infrared Remote Control) package. If not already part of your
distribution you can download LIRC from <a
href="http://www.lirc.org">http://www.lirc.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
The mpeg plugin needs the library <b>RTE</b>, you can get it from the same
place you get Zapping.

<header>Downloading CVS</header>
To get the latest development version of zapping, you can access
anonymously the cvs server. <b>Remember that there is no warranty that
it will even compile.</b> This method is mainly for developers and people
that want to have the very latest, probably very buggy,
version. Use the following:
<ol>
<li><i>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.zapping.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/zapping
login</i></li>
<li>You will be asked for a password, just hit return.</li>
<li><i>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.zapping.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/zapping
co zapping</i>.<br></br>This will checkout the latest zapping release, from now on you can
use:</li>
<li><i>cvs -z3
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.zapping.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/zapping
update -P</i><br></br>to update your local copy of the repository.</li>
</ol>
You can also <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/zapping">browse</a>
the CVS repository, or get daily <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/zapping-cvsroot.tar.gz">snapshots</a>
of the CVS tree.
<header>Downloading HTTP</header>
You can get the releases through HTTP, just follow <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2599&amp;package_id=2569">
this link</a> and download the latest version.
<p>
You can also see all the releases directly from the Sourceforge
project page <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2599">here</a>.
</p>
<p>Due to popular demand, the code that manages V4L and V4L2 has been
published as a separate package. It is the module called <b>tveng</b>,
and it is available from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zapping">Sourceforge
project page</a>.</p>
