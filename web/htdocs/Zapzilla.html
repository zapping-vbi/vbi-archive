<h2>Description</h2>
Zapzilla is the name of the Teletext browser built into Zapping. It is
probably the most advanced software Teletext decoder around,
at least it's the best one I have seen. ;-) Some of its outstanding
features are:
<ul>
  <li>Teletext Level 2.5/3.5 ("HiText") support, this includes:
  <ul>
    <li>Support for a fscking lot of languages, for example
      Turkish, Russian, Greek, Hebrew and Arabic. Internally
      we use <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>.</li>
    <li>DRCS, i.e. <a href="#DRCS">graphics</a> within the Teletext page.</li>
    <li>4096 colors, new and enhanced text attributes, a larger
      character set, more font styles, ...</li>
    <li>TOP and FLOF navigation.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Arbitrary scaling & antialiasing of rendered pages.</li>
  <li>Regular expression Unicode searching in the page cache.</li>
  <li>Export filters to HTML, PNG, PPM, ASCII, ANSI, VTX.</li>
  <li>Wrapping and rectangular text and image selection.</li>
  <li>Bookmarks.</li>
</ul>
Those are the pros, there are some cons, though:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Due to the scaling, it isn't as responsive as, say, AleVT. It really
depends on how big your iron is, and the size of the window. To make a rough
estimation, it takes about 0.1s to scale and render a 400x300 page. Not bad
for scaling and antialias. But all the credit for this speed/slowdown is
due to gdk-pixbuf, I wash my hands. :-)</li>
  <li>Zapzilla is tied to Zapping. That means tied to all the Gnome libraries.
I don't have currently the time/will to untie it myself, but if some brave
soul wants to take the challenge, here's my <a

email address</a>. Send petitions to write docs and release libvbi as a separate
entity to <a href="mailto:mschimek@users.sourceforge.net">Michael</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Screenshots</h2>
If you're not utterly impressed by now, here are the carefully crafted
screenshots you've been waiting for:<br>
<br>
<div align="Center">
<a name="DRCS"></a>
<a href="screenshots/ttx/export.jpeg"><img
src="screenshots/ttx/export_s.jpeg" alt="Export" width="400"
height="300" align="Top" border="0"></a><br>
</div>
OK, many things:<br>
There are three TTX windows here, one of them is the Zapping main window
acting as a TTX viewer. You can see the graphics in the page (Level 2.5).
Note the arbitrary scaling, each TTX page has a different size.<br>
The open dialog lets you export a page to the previously mentioned formats,
this time I am exporting to an HTML page.<br>
<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="screenshots/ttx/links.jpeg"><img
src="screenshots/ttx/links_s.jpeg" alt="Links" width="400"
height="300" align="Top" border="0"></a><br>
</div>
<div align="Justify">Apparently nothing special here, just Galeon and Zapzilla...
until your neuronal network sees the pattern: "Perhaps the Url in Galeon has been
opened by clicking in the link that appears in the TTX page?". You are
completely right, so I don't need to explain anything. I will just tell
that email adresses and page numbers are clickable too. The cryptic message
in the bottom row is part of the TOP navigation.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="screenshots/ttx/search.jpeg"><img
src="screenshots/ttx/search_s.jpeg" alt="Search" width="400"
height="300" border="0"></a><br>
<div align="Left">Zapzilla supports searching for regular expressions in
the page cache. I gave the "<b>#email#</b>" pattern to search for, the highlighted
text is the second match. The window in the back is the help window that
appears when you click the "Help" button. And in case you are wondering,
"<b>#email#</b>" isn't a regular expression, it's just a convenient alias
I added that expands into something as horrific as "<b>([:alnum:]|[-~.]+@([:alnum:]|[-~.])+)</b>
". Basically it matches email adresses. Similarly you can use the "<b>#url#</b>" alias to match WWW adresses, or any regexp you like.<br>
<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="screenshots/ttx/subtitles.jpeg"><img
src="screenshots/ttx/subtitles_s.jpeg" alt="Subtitles" width="400"
height="300" border="0"></a><br>
<div align="Justify">This isn't properly Zapzilla, but the subtitle overlay
built into Zapping in concert with the Closed Caption decoder built into
libvbi. Teletext subtitles are supported in the same way. Actually, the
Zapping mothership, subtitle overlay, Zapzilla and libvbi all participate
in the Neuromante and Wintermute of VBI decoding.<br>
<h2>People</h2>
The nominees for best original bugs, features and chrome are:
<ul>
  <li> Michael H. Schimek for the low levels of VBI, TTX & CC decoder and
       more good things in libvbi.</li>
  <li> I&ntilde;aki Garc&iacute;a Etxebarria for the GUI, the rendering and
       its overlay; the unicode regexp, selection and countless other pearls.</li>
</ul>
