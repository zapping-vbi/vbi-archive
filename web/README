This is the README file in the Zapping CVS repository web module,
which contains the master version of all files in the Zapping project
web space. All changes to the Zapping website must be made in the
repository and then uploaded to web.sourceforge.net. The Doxygen
documentation for libzvbi and librte is not in this repository,
details below.

Instructions for the website maintainer as of 2013-07-01
--------------------------------------------------------

For write access to the CVS repository and access to the SF shell and
web space you must create a SSH key pair and attach the public key to
your SF account. See the SF documentation for details. To check out
the repository for the first time on your own computer type

   cvs -d:ext:username@zapping.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/zapping checkout web

Replace username with your SF account username. For details on
updating your copy of the repository and committing changes see the
CVS documentation. To log into your SF shell account type

   ssh -t username,zapping@shell.sourceforge.net create

This will create a virtual machine, a new shell, and give you access
to your personal directory /home/users/u/us/username. The Zapping web
space is accessible under /home/project-web/zapping. To check out the
web CVS for the first time on web.sourceforge.net type

  cd /home/project-web/zapping
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@zapping.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/zapping co web
  ./prepare_web.sh

The cvs command checks out a read-only copy of the web CVS module and
./prepare_web.sh adjusts the access permissions for the Sourceforge
web server. To update this copy of the repository you can just run

  ./prepare_web.sh

We also publish a copy of the Doxygen documentation for libzvbi and
librte on the Zapping website. These files are not in the web
repository but created on the fly from the libzvbi and librte sources
and then placed under /home/project-web/zapping/doc/libzvbi or
librte. They should be updated on every new release of the libraries
by running

  ./prepare_dox.sh vbi libzvbi

or

  ./prepare_dox.sh rte librte

The first argument specifies the CVS module, the second one the
subdirectory where the HTML files are to be placed. The script checks
out the CVS module, runs Doxygen, copies the HTML files with suitable
access permissions, then deletes the CVS files. You do not need to run
./prepare_web.sh first or afterwards.

You should test and review any changes to scripts and webpages on your
own computer before you update the live website.
