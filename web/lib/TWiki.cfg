# - Latest version at http://twiki.org/
# - Installation instructions in $dataDir/TWiki/TWikiDocumentation.txt
# - Customize variables in TWiki.cfg when installing TWiki.
# - Optionally create a new plugin or customize DefaultPlugin.pm for
#   custom extensions of rendering rules.
# - Upgrading TWiki is easy as long as you only customize DefaultPlugin.pm.

# languages.  Ignored if $useLocale is 0.
#
# Locale names are not standardised - check 'locale -a' on your system to
# see what's installed, and check this works using command line tools.  You
# may also need to check what charsets your browsers accept - the
# 'preferred MIME names' at http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets
# are a good starting point.
#
# WARNING: Topics are stored in site character set format, so data conversion of
# file names and contents will be needed if you change locales after
# creating topics whose names or contents include 8-bit characters.

# locale (from 'locale -a') whose character set is not supported by your
# chosen conversion module (i.e. Encode for Perl 5.8 or higher, or
# Unicode::MapUTF8 for other Perl versions).  For example, the locale
# 'ja_JP.eucjp' exists on your system but only 'euc-jp' is supported by
# Unicode::MapUTF8, set $siteCharsetOverride to 'euc-jp'.  Leave this as ""
# if you don't have this problem.

# characters by putting any '8-bit' accented national characters within
# these strings - i.e. $upperNational should contain upper case non-ASCII
# letters.  This is termed 'non-locale regexes' mode.
#
# If 'non-locale regexes' is in effect, WikiWord linking will work, but 
# some features such as sorting of WikiWords in search results may not.  
# These features depend on $useLocale, which can be set independently of
# $localeRegexes, so they will work with Perl 5.005 as long as 
# $useLocale is set to 1 and you have working locales.
#
# Using the recommended setup of Perl 5.6.1 with working locales avoids the
# need to set these parameters.
