# setlib.cfg: configuration file for TWiki and Perl library paths
#
# Used to configure non-standard locations for TWiki and Perl modules.


# -------------- Only needed to work around an Apache 2.0 bug on Unix
#
#    If you are running TWiki on Apache 2.0 on Unix you might experience cgi
#    scripts to hang forever. This is a known Apache 2.0 bug. A fix is 
#    available at http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=%2022030.
#    It is recommended to patch your Apache installation.
#
#    As a workaround, uncomment one of the following two lines. (As a drawback,
#    errors will not be reported anymore to the browser via CGI::Carp)

# open(STDERR, ">>/dev/null");         # throw away cgi script errors, or
# open(STDERR, ">>/tmp/error.log");    # redirect errors to a log file of choice


# -------------- Change these settings if required

#    Path to lib directory containing TWiki.pm.
#    ATTENTION: Set to absolute file path:
$twikiLibPath = '../lib';

#    Path to local Perl modules (e.g. under home directory for users
#    without 'root' on Unix/Linux). Uncomment and set if needed:
# $localPerlLibPath = '';


# -------------- Don't change anything below this line

# Prepend to @INC, the Perl search path for modules
unshift @INC, $twikiLibPath;
unshift @INC, $localPerlLibPath if $localPerlLibPath;

1;			    	# Return success for module loading
