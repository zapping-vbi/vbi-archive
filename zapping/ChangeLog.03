	  dirname which gdk-pixbuf-csource, that's some/bin.
	  Was a bad idea to begin with, removed.

2003-11-17    <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/tvengxv.c, src/tvengemu.c, src/tvengbktr.c,
	  src/tveng_private.h, src/tveng25.c, src/tveng2.c,
	  src/tveng1.c, src/tveng.c: Recursive tveng_device_info->
	  priv->mutex didn't work, replaced by fast type. Divided
	  a few tveng_ funcs for internal use without locking.

2003-11-13    <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c (py_record): Missing check if dialog

	  in tv_overlay_buffer (dga_param).
	* src/tveng.h: Replaced image format parameters in struct
	  tv_overlay_buffer by tv_image_format. Replaced base pointer by
	  ulong, since it refers to another address space.
	* src/tveng.c (tv_pixfmt_bytes_per_pixel): Added to speed up future
	  copy functions.
	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c (video_callback): Missing retrieve_frame(),
	  abort loop if necessary.
	  (do_start): Preliminary hack to prefer native image format
	  if 4:2:0 or 4:2:2. Missing size locking of requested capture

	  (py_toggle_mode): Logic fix.

2003-11-04    <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/options.c: Locale to UTF-8 fixes.
	* common/fifo.h, common/fifo.c, src, plugins/mpeg: Prefixed
	  fifo functions and types to prevent linker accidents because
	  the fifo functions aren't binary compatible with their rte
	  clones if rte was compiled with linuxthreads and zapping
	  with nptl, or vice versa. Ported from 0.6 branch.

2003-10-17    <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/frequencies.c (tv_rf_channel_next): Off-by-one error
	  skipping last channel in range.

	  frequency change on 09-24.

	* src/capture.c (request_capture_format_real): No
	  tveng_set_capture_format call if the format is still the same.
	* src/tveng.c (tveng_set_capture_format): We have a few problems in
          request_capture_format_real, see TODO. Fix is complex. For now
	  this function will block requests for RGB formats. Zapping 0.0
	  to 0.6 worked well enough this way.
	  (tveng_copy_frame): assume_yvu useless, removed. Implicit YVU420
	  to YUV420 conversion removed.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: tveng_assume_yvu() useless, removed.
	* src/video_xv.c (traverse_ports): Did not register YVU420 ports.
	  (image_new): Proper U/V plane swapping for YUV/YVU 4:2:0, support
	  more packed formats.

2003-10-10    <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c,
	  plugins/screenshot/screenshot.glade: Brushed up the dialogs.

2003-10-09    <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/video_x11.c (image_new): Incorrect pixfmt assertion.
	* src/frequencies.c (tveng_tuned_channel_copy): Function
	  decomposed characters with diacritical marks, solution
	  s/G_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT/G_NORMALIZE_DEFAULT_COMPOSE.
	* src/xawtv.c (xawtv_import_config): Handle non-ASCII
	  channel names.
	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added z_set_window_bg().
	* src/zmisc.c, src/overlay.c, src/fullscreen.c: Setting window
	  background did not, or not immediately, show.
	
2003-10-07    <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/frequencies.c (tv_rf_channel_next): Still didn't work
	  right. Fixed again, hopefully for the last time.
	* src/tvengxv.c: Cleaned up a bit.
	  (grab_port): NVidia tv out bug workaround.
	  (set_overlay): Fixed return values.
	* src/video_xv.c (add_backend_xv): Cleaned and split up
	  for better readability. Listing XVideo resources moved
	  into helper function in src/x11_stuff.c.
	  (tveng2xv): Removed, the module now remembers the
	  image format id reported by xvlib.
	  (tveng2bpp): Replaced by tv_pixfmt_to_pixel_format().
	* src/zmisc.c (zmisc_switch_mode): Proper overlay and fullscreen
	  error messages.
	* src/tveng2.c (tveng2_set_capture_format): Capture didn't work,
	  added tveng_stop/restart to remap buffers after format change.
	* src/tveng.c (tv_set_overlay_buffer): Missing slash in
	  zapping_setup_fb install path. Improved error messages.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h:
	  Moved preview functions into fullscreen.c.
	* src/main.c: Moved zapping_setup_fb call into overlay.c
	  and fullscreen.c, where it is called only before DMA
	  overlay is actually activated (mostly for error
	  reporting reasons). Removed Xv detection which existed
	  here only to bypass zapping_setup_fb when we (apparently)
	  have Xv overlay capability. Fixed start-muted.
        * src/video_x11.c: Replaced zmisc_resolve_pixformat()
	  call by global dga_param access, which already contains
	  the required information.
 	* src/overlay.c: Proper overlay target initialization.
	* src/fullscreen.c: Moved tveng preview functions here.
	  Removed superfluous (when we're using XVideo)
	  tv_set_overlay_buffer() call.
	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c, plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c,
	  src/capture.c, src/capture.h, src/csconvert.c,
	  src/csconvert.h, src/main.c, src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h,

	  src/video_x11.c, src/video_xv.c, src/x11_stuff.c,
	  src/x11_stuff.h, src/yuv2rgb.c, src/zimage.c,
	  src/zimage.h, src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h:
	  Replaced tveng_frame_pixformat by tv_pixfmt and tv_pixfmt_set,
	  which covers more formats and is more accurate WRT color
	  component order and endianess. (So accurate in fact, it
	  revealed a V4L2 API bug.)
	* src/zmisc.h (zmisc_resolve_pixformat): No longer needed.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h, src/tveng_private.h: Replaced
	  tv_video_standard_id by tv_videostd and tv_videostd_set
	  a la tv_pixfmt, under the "no surprise today will keep
	  the bug away" rule.
	  (pig_depth_to_pixfmt): New helper function for backends.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h:
	  (tveng_set_xv_port): Missing XFree().
	  (tveng_detect_xv_overlay): No longer needed, see main.c.
	  (tveng_is_planar): No longer needed, replaced by
	    TV_PIXFMT_IS_PLANAR() and tv_pixfmt_to_pixel_format().
	  (tv_pixfmt_name): Added, for debugging.
	  (tv_pixfmt_to_pixel_format): Extended. Replaces
	  tveng_frame_pixformat to tv_pixel_format function of
	  same name.
	  (tv_videostd_name): Added, for debugging.
	* src/main.c, src/globals.c, src/globals.h: Obsoleted --no-zsfb
	  switch. zapping_setup_fb is no longer called at startup but only
	  when we actually switch to dma overlay.
	* zapping_setup_fb/v4l.c, zapping_setup_fb/v4l2.c,
	  zapping_setup_fb/v4l25.c: Did not properly distinguish between
	  24 and 32 bpp.
	* src/x11stuff.c, src/x11stuff.h: Added XVideo helper functions.

2003-09-27	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/tveng1.c (p_tveng1_open_device_file): ioctl
	  BTTV_VERSION failure is non-fatal.
	* src/tveng1.c, src/tveng2.c, src/tveng25.c, src/tvengbktr.c:
	  s/open/device_open, s/close/device_close (debugging).
	* src/properties-handler.c (picture_sizes_on_menu_activate):
	  Fixed wrong selection.
	* src/v4linterface.c (load_control_values): Fixed, cleaned.
	* src/frequencies.c (tveng_tuned_channel_set_control): Added.
	* src/frequencies.h: Removed obsolete declarations.

2003-09-24	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: Restored libxml check from
	  0.6.x for src/zconf.
	* configure.in: Added BSD driver check, cleanup.
	* src/Makefile.am, src/keyboard.c:
	  Replaced z_key editing widget by eggcellrendererkeys.
	* src/Makefile.am, src/channel_editor.c: Added channel list
	  import from xawtv config file.
	* src/frequencies.c: Resynched frequency tables with
	  XawTV for config import function. Added SE Asian tables.
	* src/frequencies.h: Changed all frequency values to Hz unit.
	* src/i18n.c: New SE Asian country names.
	* src/channel_editor.c: Fixed standard and input option menu.
	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added a few gtk_tree_view helper
	  functions. Added z_device_entry_grab_focus().
	* src/tvengbktr.c: Cleaned up, removed old cruft, compiles now.
	  But doesn't do anything useful yet. :-(
	* src/tveng.c (tv_set_overlay_buffer):  First try the
	  zapping_setup_fb install path.
	* src/audio.c, src/audio.h, src/properties-handler.c:
	  Rewrote audio device selection in preferences.
	  Cleaned up audio preferences. Added mute on exit option.
	  Removed mute on channel switch option, always on now.
	* src/zmisc.c: Always mute on channel switch.
	* src/cmd.c: Mute on exit optional.
	* src/callbacks.c, src/callbacks.h: No longer used. The
	  remaining button press cb moved into src/interface.c.
	* src/main.c (on_zapping_key_press): Missing call to
	  on_picture_size_key_press().
	* zapping_setup_fb/v4l.c, zapping_setup_fb/v4l2.c,
	  zapping_setup_fb/v4l25.c: Missing #include w/o ENABLE_V4L.
	* plugins, src:	Make VPATH include fixes.
	  (cmd_register): Replaced description and example by
	  set of macros.

2003-08-26	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Teletext doesn't hang anymore. TTXView windows
	  now have a main menu, roughly as recommended in GHIG. Show
	  toolbar/statusbar options inhibited, must investigate how this
	  should be properly implemented. Quit item inhibited, keeps
	  crashing, reason to be investigated. Toolbar improvements:
	  History finally works as expected, page numbers display better,
	  page up/down/etc buttons rearrange on orientation change.
	  Removed Stop button, windows ought to have a close button and
	  we still have the main menu. Added on_toggle and zconf callbacks
	  for reveal button, fixes possible display inconsistency. Fixed
	  attaching to main window toolbar. Creates smaller toolbar for
	  main window. New Python command to open page link in current
	  window. Search dialog not modal anymore. Unified text input
	  dialog and progress display (actually no more progress display,
	  libzvbi needs a fix for proper function). Help button disabled,
	  help needs update for Gnome 2. Export dialog not modal anymore.
	  Format selection moved from submenu (in main_window from popup
	  subsubmenu :-P) into dialog. Removed electric filename, needs
	  work. Fixed bug picking up the wrong file extension. Fixed
	  tabulation of widgets in color dialog, changed to spin slider
	  as in controls dialog. Brushed up bookmarks dialog. Libzvbi
	  strings coded in Latin1 or locale are converted to UTF-8.
	  Rearranged TTXView context menu. Different menus depending on
	  link type, added Open and Open in New Window items. Changed
	  Export to Save as. Create modified context menu for Teletext
	  view in main window. Removed all Teletext widgets from
	  zapping.glade, these are now custom built in ttxview.c. Cleanups.
	* pixmaps/reveal.png: Reveal is now a normal toolbar button,
	  had to resize icon to keep it in line with other buttons.
	* src/interface.c, src/properties-handler.c, src/zvbi.c,
	  src/zvbi.h: Removed program and network info stuff, vbi triggers.
	  Were barely useful and the GUI sucked. Maybe later.
	* src/zvbi.c: Libzvbi network name coded in Latin1 is converted
	  to UTF-8.
	  (vbi_gui_sensitive): Simplified.
	* src/v4linterface.c (add_controls): Properly pad box.
	  (substitute_keywords): Program and network info temporarily
	  unavailable, needs a rewrite.
	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Cleanup in
	  [z_toolbar_]set_style_recursive(). propagate_toolbar_changes()
	  no longer needed, removed. z_strlcpy() added for tveng.

	* src/capture.c, src/cmd.c, src/overlay.c, src/properties-handler.c,
	  src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h, src/zmisc.c, src/zvbi.c:
	  Added tveng_capture_mode TVENG_TELETEXT (which is, naturally,
	  not handled by tveng itself but I don't want to break too many
	  things at once by splitting into a capture and display mode).
	  TVENG_NO_CAPTURE changed meaning to "no display", so we have a
	  state to start from or to fall back.
	* src/zmisc.c (zmisc_stop): Blanks the window since a restart
	  may fail. Basically this is what TVENG_NO_CAPTURE displays.
	  (zmisc_switch_mode): Moved ttxview_detach() into zmisc_stop().
	  Changed appearance of Teletext toolbar button to toggle
	  between Teletext and Video. Separated TVENG_NO_CAPTURE and
	  TVENG_TELETEXT start code.

	* src/interface.c: Zapping GnomeApp, its menu, toolbar
	  and popup menu are now built here instead of by Glade.
	  Better control, no more working around Glade flaws.
	* src/main.c, src/properties-handler.c: Added toolbar style
	  option and zconf, then I discovered Gnome has one already.
	  Code disabled until I know how to properly handle the
	  conflict while satisfying GHIG. Removed "avoid flicker"
	  option and zconf, not used anymore.
	* src/interface.c: Added zconf hooks to automagically
	  update menus when hide-toolbar-and-menu and
	  keep-window-on-top config changes. Hook also
	  hides/shows toolbar and menu.
	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: zapping_stock.h was a stupid idea,
	  removed. Rating pixmaps are no longer installed, the code
	  using them is gone. For now.
	* src/main.c: Replaced stupid zapping_stock.h.
	* src/audio.c, src/interface.c, src/interface.h,
	  src/properties.c: Added optional parent widget parameter to
	  register_widget, in case the widget is no child of main_window.
	* src/audio.c, src/interface.c: Replaced "bonobodockitem"
	  widget names by gnome_app_get_dock_item_by_name().
	* src/callbacks.c (on_tv_screen_button_press_event): Moved popup
	  menu initialization into create_popup_menu1().
	* src/main.c: Hide toolbar and menu via zconf hook after
	  main_window was shown, has no effect before. :-P
	* src/cmd.c (py_toggle_mode): Made no sense, cleaned up.
	  (py_keep_on_top): Moved menu item update into zconf hook.
	  (py_help): Disabled, help stuff needs rewrite for Gnome 2.

	* glade/zapping2.glade: Removed a number of obsolete widgets,
	  others are now custom built. Removed "avoid flicker in
	  preview mode" option, not used anymore. Could return
	  later as a hidden option, this just isn't anything the
	  average user cares about.

	* src/overlay.c (on_video_window_event): Added GDK_EXPOSE
	  case, is need when child windows (like popup menu submenu)
	  disappear. 
	* src/fullscreen.c (osd_model_changed): Fixed automatic
	  recentering of view.
	* src/x11stuff (x11_vidmode_list_new): Turned out the server
	  does not behave as expected.
	  (x11_vidmode_switch, x11_vidmode_restore): Make sure this
	  works right when switching to the present vidmode.

	* src/zconf.c, src/zconf.h: Added option to zconf_add_hook()
	  to call the hook for initialization right away. Added
	  zconf_hook_widget_show(), a generic hook.

	* help/Makefile.am: Removed C, de subdirs. Help files and
	  installation need a rewrite for Gnome 2.

	* plugins/alirc/alirc.c, plugins/lirc/lirc.c, plugins/lirc/mpeg.c,
	  plugins/lirc/screenshot.c, src/audio.c, src/callbacks.c,
	  src/fullscreen.c, src/interface.c, src/keyboard.c, src/main.c,
	  src/remote.c, src/remote.h, src/zvbi.c:
	  Renamed python command calls, added optional widget
	  parameter to properly identify the caller.

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Replaced code which is now in
	  z_electric_replace_extension().

	* src/properties-handler.c (zapping.picture_size_cycle):
	  Wrong error message.

	* src/frequencies.c (tv_rf_channel_next): Fixed bug adding
	  null channel in channel editor frequency table.

	* src/channel_editor.c, src/plugin_properties.c,
	  src/properties-handler.c, src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h:
	  New convenience function z_label_set_text_printf().

	* src/channel_editor.c: Replaced tveng_tune_input by
	  tv_set_tuner_frequency().

	* src/tveng.c (panel_failure, REQUIRE_IO_MODE): Block some
	  functions when the controller is in TVENG_ATTACH_CONTROL mode.
	  Saves similar checks in the backends.
	  (support_failure, REQUIRE_SUPPORT): Abort some functions
	  when the controller doesn't support it. Replaces UNSUPPORTED
	  macro.
	  (tv_get_tuner_frequency, tv_set_tuner_frequency):
	  Replacement for tveng_get_tune, tveng_tune_input.
	  (tveng_get_tuner_bounds): Removed. This information is now
	  available directly in struct tv_tuner.
	  (tv_set_overlay_buffer): Worked only when the driver was
	  initialized for overlay before.
	  (tveng_start_previewing): Limit window size to video standard
	  nominal picture size.
	  (tv_clip_vector_to_clip_mask): Added, untested. Primarily for
	  tveng backends, for drivers supporting only a clip mask.
	* src/tveng.h (tv_clip_vector_to_clip_mask): Added, untested.
	  (tv_get_tuner_frequency, tv_set_tuner_frequency):
	  Replacement for tveng_get_tune, tveng_tune_input.
	  (tveng_get_tuner_bounds): Removed. This information is now
	  available in struct tv_tuner.
	* src/tveng_private.h:
	  Rewrote tuner frequency interface, now with bounds in
	  struct tv_tuner, promise of per-tuner frequency setting and
	  control like change callbacks. Unit is Hz instead of kHz
	  or whatever the driver likes. Cleanups.
	* src/tveng1.c: Rewrote tuner frequency code. V4L does not
	  promise per-tuner frequency settings, so we enforce that here.
	  Added rudimentary panel mode. Some cleanup as usual. :-)
	* src/tveng2.c: Rewrote tuner frequency code. V4L2 does not
	  promise per-tuner frequency settings, so we enforce that here.
	  Cleanups.
	* src/tveng25.c: Rewrote tuner frequency code.
	* src/tvengemu.c: Rewrote tuner frequency code.	
	  (add_controls): Fixed incorrect action and color control bounds.
	* src/tvengxv.c: Rewrote tuner frequency code. Parsing of encoding
	  string (standard-input) was backwards.
	* src/tveng1.c (v4l_ioctl_nf): New macro to call ioctl without
	  error report, used when EINVAL is expected.
	  (tveng1_set_control): Fixed bogus non-handling of audio
	  control error.
	* src/tveng2.c (v4l2_ioctl_nf): New macro to call ioctl without
	  error report, used when EINVAL is expected.
	  (add_control): Workaround for drivers reporting wrong boolean
	  and action control bounds.
	* src/tveng25.c (v4l25_ioctl_nf): New macro to call ioctl without
	  error report, used when EINVAL is expected.
	  (add_control): Workaround for drivers reporting wrong boolean
	  and action control bounds. None observed yet, but just in case.
	* src/tveng1.h, src/tveng2.h, src/tveng25.h, src/tvengemu.h,
	  src/tvengxv.h: Removed no longer needed function declarations.

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Updated.
	* configure.in: Incremented version number for intermediate
	  release. Disabled help Makefile targets, these need work.

2003-07-28	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvideo.c: Gtk version check for aspect bug.

	* configure.in: gdk_pixbuf_csource helper app check.
	* pixmaps: Some work to embed pixmaps as stock into the application
	  instead of loading at runtime, unfinished.
	* src/main.c (init_zapping_stock): Added.
	* plugins/mpeg/Makefile.am, plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Use GtkPixdata
	  and application stock instead of loading pixmaps at runtime.
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Use application stock instead
	  of loading toolbutton image at runtime.
	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Rewrote helper functions for application
	  stock icons.
	* src/ttxview.c: Use GtkPixdata and application stock instead of
	  loading pixmaps at runtime.

	* glade/zapping.glade2: "s/Hide// menu and toolbar" as recommeded
	  in HIG. Use application stock pixmaps.
	* src/callbacks.c (on_tv_screen_button_press_event), src/cmd.c
	  (py_hide_controls): Changed hide/show menu and toolbar menu to
	  check menu as recommended in HIG.
	* src/interface.c: Added on_toggle callbacks for toolbar and
	  keep-on-top check menus calling python. Fixes possible keep-on-top
	  menu check mark and state inconsistency.

	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h, src/tveng_private.h: Replaced video
	  input	and video standard vectors of tveng_device_info by linked
	  lists, with appropriate methods, callbacks, helper functions
	  and macros.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: Rewrote tv_control and its methods to
	  follow the design of other enumerated items.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: tv_callback_s/node//, Added
	  tv_callback_fn type.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng_private.h, src/tveng1.c,
	  src/tveng2.c, src/tveng25.c: Helper function ioctl_failure
	  to record ioctl name and errno in case of failure. Called
	  automagically from ioctl macros.
	* src/v4linterface.c: Don't make station menu insensitive when there
	  are no channels, we still have baseband inputs. Rewrote video
	  input and video standard menu building functions. These are now
	  radio menus with automatic update and rebuilding taking advantage
	  of tv_callbacks.
	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added z_menu_shell_nth_item() helper.
	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c, src/channel_editor.c, src/main.c,
	  src/properties-handler.c, src/zmisc.c: Updated for new video input
	  and standard enumeration.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: Replaced tv_mixer_line by generic
	  tv_audio_line. Added audio input list to tveng_device_info, audio
	  input helper functions, not used yet.
	* src/audio.c, src/globals.c, src/globals.h, src/mixer.c, src/oss.c:
	  Replaced tv_mixer_line by generic tv_audio_line.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: Work towards audio mode interface
	  (mono/stereo/...), unfinished.

	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: Replaced tveng_clip by tv_clip and
	  tv_clip_vector structures and methods, updated tveng_window (now
	  tv_overlay_window) accordingly. Makes things a lot cleaner. New
	  function tv_clip_vector_add_clip_xy sorts clips, will be necessary
	  for bktr.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: Rewrote get/set frame buffer
	  routines. Setting checks if already initialized, saving the
	  zapping_setup_fb call, and again if the helper really worked as
	  expected.
	* src/tveng.c (tveng_set_preview): DMA target check before
	  overlay is enabled to prevent memory corruption.
	* src/tveng1.c, src/tveng2.c, src/tveng25.c, src/tvengxv.c,
	  src/tvengemu.c, src/tveng1.h, src/tveng2.h, src/tveng25.h,
	  src/tvengxv.h, src/tvengemu.h: Rewrote video input, standard and
	  some overlay functions. Removed redundant detect_preview and
	  start/stop_previewing (fullscreen overlay) functions.
	* src/tvengemu.c, src/tveng_private.h: Added tv_set_overlay_buffer
	  function. Not used yet, except in tvengemu.c where calling
	  zapping_setup_fb makes no sense.
	* src/main.c (main): Pixfmt breakdown in DGA parameter dump. Moved
	  zapping_setup_fb call after device open to permit check if
	  parameters are already initialized.
	* src/overlay.c, src/overlay.h: Major cleanup. Fixed (non-)clipping
	  against window bounds (right border trashing bug due to DMA
	  overlay alignment by (bttv <= 0.8) driver), tooltip flicker,
	  screen cleanup. All windowed overlay is now controlled by
	  start_overlay() and stop_overlay() in this file.
	* src/x11stuff.c, src/x11stuff.h: Rewrote clip vector building
	  routines. Simpler now, and take window boundary into account.
	* src/fullscreen.c: Update to new tv_overlay_window and
	  tv_clip_vector.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: Replaced tveng_fb_info by
	  tv_overlay_buffer structure, also used to hold DGA parameters.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h, src/video_mem.c: Added
	  tv_pixfmt_to_pixel_format(), with argument struct tv_pixel_format.
	  Breaks down pixfmt, for clients requiring more details.
	  Accordingly removed redundant color depth and bpp from DGA
	  parameters and tveng_pixformat_bits_per_pixel function.
	* src/x11stuff.c, src/x11stuff.h: Replaced x11_dga_parameters by
	  tv_overlay_buffer structure in DGA routines. The same structure
	  is used in tveng to program overlay.
	* src/globals.c, src/globals.h: Replaced x11_dga_parameters by
	  tv_overlay_buffer.
	* src/zmisc.c (zmisc_stop): Replaced tveng_stop_everything() calls,
	  this function is tveng internal now.
	* src/zmisc.c (zmisc_restart): Removed, tveng_restart_everything()
	  is tveng internal now and the function wasn't used anyway.
	* src/zmisc.c (zmisc_switch_mode): Replaced obsolete
	  tveng_detect_preview() call. Simplified switch to windowed
	  overlay, all initialization now in overlay.c/start_overlay().
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h, src/tveng_private.h: Added
	  tv_set_overlay_xwindow as set_overlay_buffer (video memory)
	  counterpart.
	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h, src/tveng_private.h:
	  tveng_stop_everything() conflicts with encapsulation of overlay
 	  code in overlay.c, therefore now tveng internal. Actually it
	  shouldn't be used at all (before video standard change etc),
	  permitting asynchronous video parameter changes and what not.
	  But fixing this is complicated, postponed until a later date.
	* src/tveng.c (round_boundary_4): Replaced doubleword alignment of
	  images by more elaborate rounding function.

	* src/capture.c (scan_device): Restore pixfmt after scan.
	* common/Makefile.am: VPATH fix: location of structpr_gen.pl script.
	* common/types.h, src/zmisc.h: PARENT macro passes through NULL.
	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added z_strlcpy() helper. Sane version
	  of strncpy, idea from FreeBSD.
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: #include <sys/stat.h> for 
	  device_open_safer(). Oops.

2003-05-28	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Fix incompatibility
	  with RH9 nptl library, wrong assumption about pthread_t.
	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am,
	  zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.pam: Consolehelper
	  mediation didn't work on RH9. Fix borrowed from v4l-conf.

2003-04-26	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Cleaned up & improved filename
	  helpers. In particular z_on_electric_filename() didn't work
	  right. Added z_electric_replace_extension(), better than
	  tinkering with text entry directly.
	* src/ttxview.c, src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: z_build_filename()
	  no longer needed, use glib 2.0 g_build_filename().
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Use
	  z_electric_replace_extension().
	* plugins/screenshot/Makefile.am,
	  plugins/screenshot/screenshot_strings.c: Switched to
	  intltool. screenshot_strings.c obsolete, removed.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Intltoolized screenshot plugin.

	* src/capture.c: Race in capture resize logic, added
	  added rwlock.
	* src/capture.c: Restored on_capture_canvas_allocate()
	  to (if possible) resize captured image to window
	  size. Provisional.
	* src/capture.c (find_request_size): Default capture size
	  determined by window size. Provisional.

	* src/zvideo.c, src/zvideo.h: Added cursor blanked signal.
	* src/fullscreen.c (on_cursor_blanked): Automagically
	  recenter view.
	* src/fullscreen.c (fullscreen_start): Fixed black background.
	* src/interface.c (create_zapping): Fixed black background.

	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h, src/tveng1.c, src/tveng2.c,
	  src/tveng25.c, src/tvengxv.c, src/tvengemu.c,
	  src/v4linterface.c: Made tv_control.next and .ignore
	  private as planned. Added tv_control_next() function.
	* src/tveng_private.h, src/tveng.c: Moved control and image
	  copy helper functions, pointless to inline.
	* src/tveng.h: New tveng_pixformat_bits_per_pixel() helper.
	* src/tvengbktr.c: Some progress, but still unfinished.

	Remove some duplicate code. Won't help security but it 
	helps maintenance.
	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am: Include src/ headers. Um.
	* src/x11stuff.c (x11_dga_query), src/x11stuff.h: Added
	  optional display_name parameter.
	* zapping_setup_fb/dga.c: Replaced by x11stuff.c code.
	  Later zapping_setup_fb should link tveng.
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c, zapping_setup_fb/v4l.c,
	  zapping_setup_fb/v4l2.c, zapping_setup_fb/v4l25.c,
	  zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.h: Use
	  common/device interface instead of local copy. Use
	  x11_dga_parameters (x11stuff.h) parameter instead of globals.

	* glade/zapping.glade2: Eliminated nested toolbar widgets
	  creating unwanted border around channel up/down buttons.
	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Format request fix. Hint to self,
	  never forget to clear unused fields.

2003-03-25	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c: "Add all" aligns channel name with
	  channel list number in NTSC country. Automatically select
	  channel_txl option depending on country.
	* src/frequencies.c, src/frequencies.h: Added channel number
	  alignment hint. Fixed tv_rf_channel_next(), specifically
	  using the French frequency table.
	* v4linterface.c: Don't list unnamed stations in menus.

2003-03-24	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am: Patch #706599 by Kris Verbeeck
	  to fix installation on Gentoo Linux.

2003-03-22	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: Fixed path of zapping.desktop icon.
	* src/oss.c (oss_mixer_set_rec_line): Fixed incorrect
	  set of record lines.

2003-03-21	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade2, src/properties-handler.c: Removed ratio
	  option, needs rewrite. Auto ratio doesn't work as suggested,
	  belongs into menu, ought to use ZVideo.
	* glade/zapping.glade2: Replaced tv_screen GtkDrawingArea.
	* src/Makefile.am: added zvideo.c, zvideo.h.
	* src/cmd.c: Fixed shutdown muting incorrectly recorded in config.
	* src/fullscreen.c: Switched from GtkDrawingArea to ZVideo. Paint
	  video background black.
	* src/interface.c: Replaced tv_screen GtkDrawingArea by ZVideo.
	  Paint window background black. Fixed toolbar up/down command
	  connection.
	* src/main.c: Removed 1-unit-height hack. Removed geometry hints
	  timeout hack. This is now better addressed (I hope) in ZVideo.
	  Moved hide-pointer functions into ZVideo, is cleaner. Fixed
	  first startup video size 0,0. Fixed saving of global
	  (vs. per-channel) controls.
	* src/properties-handler.c: Control window size increment with

	  ("record volume" which is BS, see ROADMAP) Python command, added
	  zapping.control_incr() command. zapping.control_incr('volume', ...),
	  [+]/[-], controls box volume is now all the same, using video device
	  or soundcard mixer as configured.

	  in conditional.
	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c, plugins/mpeg/options.c, src/zvbi.c:
	  Compile warning fixes.

	* src/zvbi.c: Don't abort on i/o error, does more harm than good.
	  Needs a better solution, perhaps in libzvbi.
	
2003-02-20	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* common/Makefile.am, common/device.c, common/device.h,
	  common/structpr_gen.pl: Added script to generate ioctl
	  argument printing and testing functions, and the respective

	* src/tveng.c, src/tveng.h: Switch to tv_control with better
	  encapsulation of controller specifics and callbacks, numerous
	  small changes. Attn tveng_device_info.controls changed from vec
	  to list. Added tveng_update_control(). Moved sanity checks from
	  controllers into tveng_set_control(). tveng_*_control_by_id()
	  preliminary disabled. tveng_*_mute() use controls, controller

	* src/tveng.c (tveng_start_previewing), src/tveng_private.h:
	  Rewrote to use new x11_vidmode routines.
	* src/tveng1.c (tveng1_start_previewing),
	  src/tveng2.c (tveng2_start_previewing): Center fullscreen
	  overlay over root window instead of viewport, same as
	  Xv overlay. Accordingly x11_vidmode_switch() centers and

	* src/v4linterface.c: Update controls faster on channel switch etc.
	* src/audio.c: Restored mute button/controls binding.

2002-12-24	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c, src/channel_editor.h: Rewrote from scratch.
	  Modify button dropped, text entries change the list directly now.
	  Add button adds blank channel. Modification of multiple channels
	  works better. Station search channel name from vbi works better
	  (for me from ttx/vps, anyway), although it runs a bit slower now.
	  Station search and add-all does not add already known channels.
	  Internal the dialog isn't modal and global_channel_list is edited,
	  so all changes are put into effect immediately (needs more work).
	  Cancel button or close restores the old list. Added missing
	  channel_editor.h file.
	* src/frequencies.c, src/frequencies.h: Rewrote tuned_channel
	  routines. Cleaner and UTF-8 safe.

	  cleaned up to permit z_key_entry signal callback.
	* src/keyboard.c: Commands in key bindings loaded from config now
	  automagically translated from pre-0.7 syntax to Python (e.g.
	  channel up/dn).
	* src/remote.c, src/remote.h (cmd_compatibility): Added to
	  translate pre-0.7 syntax commands.
	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Spinslider cleanup. Reset button
	  now cycles between current, previous and reset value.

	* plugins/template: Restored.

2002-09-09	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/frequencies.c: Added Canada cable contributed by "matt".

2002-08-22	First simple tests <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* capture.c: Testing the new code. Works more or less with the
	TVeng_emu driver. Appears to have fewer bugs than i expected,
	yeeha! :-) Commiting, so the world finally sees the
	breakage. Plugins are broken, btw.
	* video_xv.c, video_x11.c: (later) Both work fine, sometimes i
	find myself utterly amazing:-)

2002-08-18	capture.c finished <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* capture.c: Finished modulo a couple simple things, I will do
	those tomorrow, but Z compiles again (at last!).

2002-08-15	capture.c <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* capture.c: Wrote the complex logic, doesn't compile yet, but the
	remaining pieces are a piece of cake compared to this.

2002-08-12	video_* done <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* video_*: Finished video_xv and wrote the rest of the backends
	needed for having all the previous functionality (actually much
	more, as usual ;) Now we only need to finish capture.c and the
	rewrite will compile (but not work yet, as it will surely contain
	miriads of bugs and/or typos).

2002-08-11	video_xv done <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* video_xv.c: Compiles. It's the xv video backend adapted to the
	new design, the rest of the backends i intend to write (x11,
	rgb and mem) will be considerably easier.

2002-08-10	Continued capture core work <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* capture.c: Wrote part of it (doesn't compile yet, though).
	* main.c, x11stuff.c: Adapted.
	* zimage.[ch]: created, it's a generic image object. Provides an
	uniform interface to the various possible accelerated kinds of
	images (Xv[Shm]Image, GdkImage, GdkPixbuf, ...), even to
	unblittable data.
	* tveng (tveng_read_frame): Made it accept a tveng_image_data
	argument instead of void* data, int stride; this syntax suports
	planar modes better.

2002-08-08	Capture core rewrite <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* capture, csconvert, video_xv...: Finished the new design for the
	capture code, hopefully it will become much clearer and
	robust when implemented.
	* csconvert.c: Rewrote rgb->rgb filters according to the new
	design.
	* yuv2rgb.c: Adapted to the new design, and enabled the rgb->yuv
	filters in the process. All this is untested, but compiles.

2002-08-03	TVeng emu <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* tvengemu.c: Created, manages a virtual device. Useful for
	debugging without convenient hw.

2002-08-02	Chroma+gtk2 fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* overlay, fullscreen: Found and fixed the infamous "video not
	redrawn with xvideo" problem, it appeared because gtk2 was drawing
	over the chromakey whenever it received an expose event. Thanks to
	Gerd Knorr for some advice regarding this bug.
	* tveng (tveng_[gs]et_chromakey): Added saner chromakey handling,
	prolly the V4L[2] code chromakey isn't 100% correct but i have no
	way to know. It isn't worse than before, anyway.

2002-07-23	Further fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* zapping: Fixes and missing functionality, it's getting quite
	usable now.

2002-07-20	Fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* lirc: Fixed a typo.
	* acinclude.in: Don't check whether we can build libs depending on
	libpython, we won't use it anyway.
	* help: Include it.
	
2002-07-19	Plugins done <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* mpeg, screenshot, lirc, alirc: Ported.
	* po: Converted to utf-8.

2002-07-17	Plugins <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* plugin_properties: Redone.
	* template: Ported.

2002-07-16	Everything except plugins <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb: Copy'n'paste.

2002-07-15	ttxview <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* ttxview: Ported, but untested.
	* zapzilla.c: Ported.
	* properties-handler: Ported.
	
2002-07-14	Small tweaks <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* cmd.c: Added some missing functions.
	* keyboard.c: Converted default bindings to Python syntax.
	* interface.c: For some strange reason sometimes (most times
	indeed) "activate" isn't invoqued for items in the appearance
	submenu of the popup menu. No idea why, and spent too much time
	with it.
	
2002-07-13	Audio, v4linterface <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* v4linterface, x11stuff: Ported.
	* arts.c, esd.c, oss.c, audio, mixer: Ported.
	* cpu, csconvert, yuv2rgb: Ported.
	* plugins: Ported. Now ~/.zapping/plugin_dirs has disappeared,
	there's a zconf key /zapping/plugins/plugins_dirs instead. This
	way, when zconf is converted to gconf we won't need .zapping any
	longer.
	* capture, preview, fullscreen: Ported but untested.
	* zmisc: Added zmisc_switch_mode routines.
	* main.c: Ported, things start to work, khewl! I can see the image
	produced by my webcam as before.

2002-07-12	Ported OSD <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* osd.c: Ported, kept some deprecated gdk_font stuff
	around since it's so much easier to use than raw Pango. As a
	little bonus osd now works even without zvbi compiled in. Moved
	the OSD properties management code in here, helps modularity.
	* zapping: Compiled with GDK_DISABLED_DEPRECATED too, fixed
	appearances of deprecated stuff.
	* src/zvbi.c: Ported.
	* remote.c: Added missing cmd_run_printf.

2002-07-11	Properties shell working <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* properties: Ported the shell code, works no problem with the
	keyboard settings. properties-handler isn't there yet.
	* video_xv.c, x11stuff: Ported. The WM_HOOKS (stay on top) isn't
	ported yet, apparently gnome-winhints has just dissapeared without
	any replacement. Stuff to work on after I make the hard things
	work.
	* zmisc: Ported all of it modulo the switch_mode routines, I
	cannot port those till I have the capture stuff working, perhaps a
	couple of days.

2002-07-10	Started high-gui stuff <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* frequencies.[ch]: Ported.
	* keyboard.c, .h, keysyms.h: Ported, compiles but untested yet
	since it requires the properties stuff, which i have't ported
	yet. This was my first exposure to GtkTreeView (GtkCList on
	steroids). While ackward at first glance, gets easier to work with
	when you get used to it.

2002-07-09	Low-gui stuff ported <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* common: Copied and pasted, this one was easy :-)
	* tveng: Ported.
	* configure.in: Brought back some missing macros.
	* src/interface.c: Added menu callbacks support.
	* zmodel: Ported to being a GObject.
	* zconf: Ported. Not completely tested, but the hook stuff, which
	is the part that could break appears to work. Zapping will be the
	definite test, though.
	* zmisc: Ported propagate_toolbar_changes; ShowBox and friends
	are now GtkMessage boxes.

2002-07-08	Started port <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* zapping: Started Gnome 2 port, it will become	zapping 0.7 when
	completed.
	* glade: Converted to glade-2, fixed a few stock pixmaps that went
	astray during the conversion. Surely there are others left. Change
	some callbacks that were using user_data to specify the action,
	this ain't easy to do with glade-2.
	* src/callbacks.c: Added on_zapping_delete_event.
	* src/remote.c: Uses the builtin Python interpreter now.
	* src/cmd.[ch]: Created, C implementation on Python methods,
	currently just quit().
	* acinclude.m4: Custom macros, necessary since there's no macros
	subdir in Gnome2 (at least by default).
	* src/interface.c: Libglade routines adapted, some stuff is
	missing yet.

	* src, glade, plugins: Added show tooltips option.

2002-06-17	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* m4, po, intl, config.rpath: Added because cannot use autogen.sh
	  gettextize --force since gettext 0.11. The fine hack insists
	  on updating already updated Makefile.am's and configure.in.
	* po/Rules-quot: s/PACKAGE VERSION/... because msgfmt complains.

2002-06-16	gettextize  <bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add m4.
	(ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): New variable.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add config.rpath.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add m4/Makefile.

2002-06-10	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/mixer.c: Try /dev/mixer before /dev/mixer0 etc, thanks to
	  Heiko Abraham for reporting. Patch by Iñaki.
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: Reduce the amount of code
	  executed with root privileges. Patch by Iñaki. Yours truly
	  cleaned up the code to make it more readable.

2002-05-30	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src: Added "keep on top" re feature request #555064.
	  Note doesn't work with sawfish, has incomplete Gnome wm proto.

2002-05-29	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg: Finished changes for rte 0.5 (still compiles with
	  rte 0.4).
	* src/x11stuff.c: Applied Iñaki's XScreensaver patch.

2002-05-28	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added set_sensitive_with_tooltips(),
	  made find_unused_name() more flexible.
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Disabled widgets explain
	  why... doesn't seem to work. :-(

2002-05-25	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/properties.c, src/properties.h: Added handler cancel
	  function.
	* src/interface.c: Modified build_widget() semantics to get
	  rid of hardcoded PACKAGE_DATA_DIR.

2002-05-24	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added z_load_pixmap() (simplification
	  and less instances of PACKAGE_PIXMAP_DIR), replaced
	  old pixmap from file creation code.
	* src/interface.c, src/properties.c, src/lirc.c: Replaced
	  old pixmap from file creation code.
	* src/ttxview.c, src/zvbi.c: Replaced old pixmap/pixbuf

	  clean.pl to retain argument order.

2002-04-17	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Some work towards the new recording
	  dialog.

2002-04-15	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c, plugins/mpeg/options.c: Ported to
	  rte 0.5 (optional), config audio and video pages now
	  sensitive only when the stream type applies. For testing
	  only.
	* configure.in: Added check for rte 0.5.

2002-04-10	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	Greetings from the chrome department:
	* src/keyboard.c: Replaced shutdown by keyboard image in prefs.
	* src/properties-handler.c: Added toolbar style option.
	* src/interface.c: Added toolbar style option and changed
	  toolbar mute button image from stock volume to crossed
	  speaker symbol.
	* src/zmisc.c: Spinslider [reset] button replaced by pixbutton,
	  needs less screen real estate and no translation.

2002-04-09	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am: In absence of consolehelper
	  install suid root zapping_setup_fb in $sbindir but $bindir
	  and create a symlink in $bindir. Now the executable is always
	  in $sbindir. Removed zsfb.capps.in, now created by
	  Makefile, to replace $prefix/sbin by $sbindir (which isn't
	  fully expanded by autoconf in zsfb.capps.in).
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_fix_overlay.in: Renamed from
	  zapping_fix_overlay. This version works exactly like
	  the new make install, honouring $bindir and $sbindir, with a
	  a provision for RPM relocation and a reversion option.

2002-04-06	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/osd.c: Fix to compile w/o zvbi.
	* src/callbacks.c: Fix to compile w/o zvbi.

2002-04-04	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_fix_overlay: Didn't work when
	  'which' found */sbin/zapping_setup_fb.

2002-04-02	tveng_detect_xv_overlay <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* src/tveng.c: Do not run zsfb if XV overlay will be used, bttv
	and v4l driver in XFree do weird things otherwise.

2002-04-01	Release 0.6.4 <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* po/es.po: Updated by Iñaki G. Etxebarria.
	* po/pl.po: Updated by Paweł Sakowski.
	* src/properties-handler.c: Use ngettext for
	  'with %d tuners' (%d > 1) string.

2002-03-23	Christian Marillat

	* po/fr.po: Updated.

2002-03-22	automake 1.6 <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Prepared for automake 1.6, removed
	  'deprecated and discouraged' acconfig.h.

2002-03-21	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/callbacks.c: quit_cmd() didn't work correctly when
	  called from Quit menu, fixed. Added subtitle_overlay
	  command to replace the toggle function of switch_mode teletext.
	* src/zapzilla.c: Added quit command (for [q]).
	
2002-03-19	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Experimental change re zapping-Bugs-527786.
	* configure.in: Added runtime tests for arts, unicode, xml.
	* callbacks.c: switch_mode_cmd() to current not remebered
	  as last mode. Extended restore_mode_cmd() to swap between
	  current/last or requested/last. Added "swap_mode" synonym.
	* keyboard.c: Replaced switch_mode by swap_mode.

2002-03-15	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: Changed messages refering
	  to "this program", which is confusing, to "zapping_setup_fb".
	* src/main.c: Replaced "overlay" in error messages by "previewing"
	  for consistency with the GUI. Actually overlay would be the better
	  term.

2002-03-12	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Added "/opt/gnome/share/aclocal" to
	  AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE() (this has to be literal since aclocal
	  scans configure.in before it's autoconf'ed), seems to
	  solve the problems we had with gnome installs in /opt.
	  See zap-misc 2001-10-15, 2002-03-09.

2002-03-10	zapping-Bugs-527984 <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/tveng1.c: Added mmap PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE for
	  bttv 0.8.x.
	* src/tveng2.c: Added mmap PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE for
	  bttv 0.8.x.
	* src/audio.c: Missing LIBZVBI conditional around
	  osd_render_sgml().
	* src/osd.c: Added dummy osd_render_sgml(), just in case.

2002-03-08	zapping_setup_fb <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am: Automake or autoconf created
	  a bad Makefile, moving the "if SUID_ZFSB" around helped. 

2002-02-26	Keyboard and command changes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Channel number entering on KP: Removed all keys except
	  0-9, decimal, enter. Decimal now runs through all channel
	  prefixes and serves as clear key.
	* src/v4linterface.c: Removed channel up/down swap option.
	* src/remote.c: Added new command functions. These replace
	  a number of on_event functions, allowing both keys and
	  glade GUI elements to trigger kind of mini scripts.
	  Will probably add more of these and extend to (a)lirc
	  and command line.
	* src/ttxview.c: Removed all key bindings except 0-9.
	  Replaced several functions by remote commands.
	* src/keyboard.c: New file. Added key entry widget based
	  on channel dialog with two changes: Reordered the 'known
	  keys' dialog key table and added a key enter function.
	  Preferences: Added keyboard section to assign commands
	  to keys. Added new one-key bindings. Key events are
	  differently handled now, see README.
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Made toolbar button
	  optional. Added two remote commands to activate, with
	  format parameter.
	* plugins/screenshot/mpeg.c: Added two remote commands
	  to activate. Had to rewrite mpeg_configured() message,
	  crashed due to a glade bug (?).
	* src/audio.c: Volume and mute remote commands.
	* src/callbacks.c: Switch mode/restore/quit remote
	  commands. (Should probably go into main.c)
	* src/channel_editor.c: Replaced key entry dialog.
	  The channel accel stuff is much cleaner now.
	* src/frequencies.c: A little renaming to reduce the
	  confusion between station name and RF channel name.

2002-02-24	Audio <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added preliminary volume +/- buttons. This affects
	  the record line volume using OSS /dev/mixer.

2002-02-25	zapping_setup_fb patch <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: Patch by David Fries.
	  zapping_setup_fb won't run because the .Xauthority is on a nfs mounted
	  directory with the server doing root squash so it can't contact the X
	  server. This patch drops the root privileges when connecting to the X
	  server.

2002-02-08	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Made threads_destroy() block-proof, fixed a td == 0
	  crash (??) in	update_vi_network().
	* src/zmisc.c: -d dumps failure cause of z_pixmap_new_from_file().

2002-02-05	Another mute fix and better KP entering <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/tvengxv.c: tveng_get|set_mute ignored controls bttv
	  mute bug workaround.	   
	* src/osd.c: Added remove timeout callback.
	* src/v4linterface.c: Uses OSD for KP channel number entering.
	* Added "channel number refers to" option.

2002-02-03	Mute fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: zmisc_switch_mode() didn't expect failure of
	  tveng_get_mute(), updated control box before restoring
	  old mute state.
	* src/callbacks.c: on_toggle_muted1_activate() didn't expect
	  failure of tveng_get_mute() and didn't update control box.
	* Added KP channel number entering suggested by Nathan G. Grennan.

2002-01-24	Added @euro charset <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* common/unicode.c: Added support for the ISO-8859-15 locale
	(@euro), and a default when the charset is unknown.
	* src/osd.c: Prefixed correctly VBI_BLUE in sax parsing, etc,
	otherwise they would be ignored.

2002-01-19	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/osd.c: Segv fix in geometry_update().
	* src/zvbi.c: threads_init(), threads_destroy() didn't
	  work correctly on failure.
	* Updated Zapzilla export docs.

2002-01-18	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Error box when the video
	  standard is unknown, used to crash.
	* src/zvbi.c: "Overlay subtitle pages
	  automatically" defaults to FALSE.

2002-01-14	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Restored v4l vbi interface, untested.

2002-01-13	libzvbi <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Ported Zapping from old libvbi to libzvbi, the new
	  standalone version in CVS, module "vbi". Right now only
	  the v4l2 interface works (oops...), ttx search doesn't
	  and the "sample filter" is gone, but the rest seems to
	  be in good shape. Zapping will also compile without
	  libzvbi, disabling all vbi features.

2002-01-08	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* ttxview.c: Page is exported with current reveal state.
	* vbi export: "TODO: TTX export ANSI colors needs improvement"
	  done, now has char set and terminal option, the stupid
	  fg/bg options are gone.
