This is for vbi decoding.  Taken from xawtv-3.19, which in turn took
it from alevt 1.5.1.
Changes:
  * Makefile.am created.
  * Removed debug code from vbi.c
  * Fixed typo in cache.c (SUB_ANY)
  * Added mem_output to exp-gfx.c
  * Made fmt_page(..) public and removed the need for passing an
	export struct
