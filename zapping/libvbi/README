  {mhs}
  * fmt_char -> common renderer attr_char (unfinished)
  * added level 2.5/3.5 character size attributes
  * modified fmt_page for level 2.5/3.5 enhanced triplets
    (mainly set-at, set-after and double height lower row correction)
  * fixed hold-mosaic bug (must hold separated attribute too)
  * added boxed/opacity attributes to fmt_page (for subtitles et al)
  * all level 1 ... 3.5 character sets, new font image
  * added packet X/28/x, M/29/x decoder, finished
