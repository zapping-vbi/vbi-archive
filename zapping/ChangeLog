	* Release 0.6.5.

01.10.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* po/nl.po: Updated by Guus Bonnema.

29.09.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src: #include fixes for GCC 2.7 (as if anyone would
	  still use it...)
	* Makefile.am: Added missing DISTCLEANFILES.
	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am: Added missing DISTCLEANFILES.
	* src/Makefile.am (COMMON_LIB): Changed to $(top_builddir).

28.09.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* po/fr.po: Updated by Christan Marillat.

27.09.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Proper setup of quickrec recording window.

26.09.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/ttxview.c, plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Changed gettext() calls to
	  dgettext() where they access library strings. Oops.

24.09.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Change rte 0.5 check to match latest revision.
	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Updated rte 0.5 interface to match latest
	  revision.

09.09.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/frequencies.c: Added Canada cable contributed by "matt".

31.08.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/tvengxv.c: Added XSync in tvengxv_tune_input as
	  suggested by bug report #599834.
	* src/v4linterface.c: Increased nap time before unmuting after
	  channel switch.
	* src/main.c: Fixed widget lookup before main window creation bug.
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: Had to restore pre-gcc3
	  macro varargs for compatibility.

19.06.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src, glade, plugins: Added show tooltips option.

17.06.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* m4, po, intl, config.rpath: Added because cannot use autogen.sh
	  gettextize --force since gettext 0.11. The fine hack insists
	  on updating already updated Makefile.am's and configure.in.
	* po/Rules-quot: s/PACKAGE VERSION/... because msgfmt complains.

16.06.2002	gettextize  <bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add m4.
	(ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): New variable.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add config.rpath.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add m4/Makefile.

10.06.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/mixer.c: Try /dev/mixer before /dev/mixer0 etc, thanks to
	  Heiko Abraham for reporting. Patch by Iñaki.
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: Reduce the amount of code
	  executed with root privileges. Patch by Iñaki. Yours truly
	  cleaned up the code to make it more readable.

30.05.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src: Added "keep on top" re feature request #555064.
	  Note doesn't work with sawfish, has incomplete Gnome wm proto.

29.05.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg: Finished changes for rte 0.5 (still compiles with
	  rte 0.4).
	* src/x11stuff.c: Applied Iñaki's XScreensaver patch.

28.05.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added set_sensitive_with_tooltips(),
	  made find_unused_name() more flexible.
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Disabled widgets explain
	  why... doesn't seem to work. :-(

25.05.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/properties.c, src/properties.h: Added handler cancel
	  function.
	* src/interface.c: Modified build_widget() semantics to get
	  rid of hardcoded PACKAGE_DATA_DIR.

24.05.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zmisc.c, src/zmisc.h: Added z_load_pixmap() (simplification
	  and less instances of PACKAGE_PIXMAP_DIR), replaced
	  old pixmap from file creation code.
	* src/interface.c, src/properties.c, src/lirc.c: Replaced
	  old pixmap from file creation code.
	* src/ttxview.c, src/zvbi.c: Replaced old pixmap/pixbuf
	  from file creation code.

20.05.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Now inherits CFLAGS from environment, modified
	  clean.pl to retain argument order.

17.04.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Some work towards the new recording
	  dialog.

15.04.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c, plugins/mpeg/options.c: Ported to
	  rte 0.5 (optional), config audio and video pages now
	  sensitive only when the stream type applies. For testing
	  only.
	* configure.in: Added check for rte 0.5.

10.04.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	Greetings from the chrome department:
	* src/keyboard.c: Replaced shutdown by keyboard image in prefs.
	* src/properties-handler.c: Added toolbar style option.
	* src/interface.c: Added toolbar style option and changed
	  toolbar mute button image from stock volume to crossed
	  speaker symbol.
	* src/zmisc.c: Spinslider [reset] button replaced by pixbutton,
	  needs less screen real estate and no translation.

09.04.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am: In absence of consolehelper
	  install suid root zapping_setup_fb in $sbindir but $bindir
	  and create a symlink in $bindir. Now the executable is always
	  in $sbindir. Removed zsfb.capps.in, now created by
	  Makefile, to replace $prefix/sbin by $sbindir (which isn't
	  fully expanded by autoconf in zsfb.capps.in).
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_fix_overlay.in: Renamed from
	  zapping_fix_overlay. This version works exactly like
	  the new make install, honouring $bindir and $sbindir, with a
	  a provision for RPM relocation and a reversion option.

06.04.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/osd.c: Fix to compile w/o zvbi.
	* src/callbacks.c: Fix to compile w/o zvbi.

04.04.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_fix_overlay: Didn't work when
	  'which' found */sbin/zapping_setup_fb.

02.04.2002	tveng_detect_xv_overlay <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* src/tveng.c: Do not run zsfb if XV overlay will be used, bttv
	and v4l driver in XFree do weird things otherwise.

01.04.2002	Release 0.6.4 <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* po/es.po: Updated by Iñaki G. Etxebarria.
	* po/pl.po: Updated by Paweł Sakowski.
	* src/properties-handler.c: Use ngettext for
	  'with %d tuners' (%d > 1) string.

23.03.2002	Christian Marillat

	* po/fr.po: Updated.

22.03.2002	automake 1.6 <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Prepared for automake 1.6, removed
	  'deprecated and discouraged' acconfig.h.

21.03.2002	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/callbacks.c: quit_cmd() didn't work correctly when
	  called from Quit menu, fixed. Added subtitle_overlay
	  command to replace the toggle function of switch_mode teletext.
	* src/zapzilla.c: Added quit command (for [q]).
	
19.03.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Experimental change re zapping-Bugs-527786.
	* configure.in: Added runtime tests for arts, unicode, xml.
	* callbacks.c: switch_mode_cmd() to current not remebered
	  as last mode. Extended restore_mode_cmd() to swap between
	  current/last or requested/last. Added "swap_mode" synonym.
	* keyboard.c: Replaced switch_mode by swap_mode.

15.03.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: Changed messages refering
	  to "this program", which is confusing, to "zapping_setup_fb".
	* src/main.c: Replaced "overlay" in error messages by "previewing"
	  for consistency with the GUI. Actually overlay would be the better
	  term.

12.03.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Added "/opt/gnome/share/aclocal" to
	  AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE() (this has to be literal since aclocal
	  scans configure.in before it's autoconf'ed), seems to
	  solve the problems we had with gnome installs in /opt.
	  See zap-misc 2001-10-15, 2002-03-09.

10.03.2002	zapping-Bugs-527984 <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/tveng1.c: Added mmap PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE for
	  bttv 0.8.x.
	* src/tveng2.c: Added mmap PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE for
	  bttv 0.8.x.
	* src/audio.c: Missing LIBZVBI conditional around
	  osd_render_sgml().
	* src/osd.c: Added dummy osd_render_sgml(), just in case.

08.03.2002	zapping_setup_fb <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am: Automake or autoconf created
	  a bad Makefile, moving the "if SUID_ZFSB" around helped. 

26.02.2002	Keyboard and command changes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Channel number entering on KP: Removed all keys except
	  0-9, decimal, enter. Decimal now runs through all channel
	  prefixes and serves as clear key.
	* src/v4linterface.c: Removed channel up/down swap option.
	* src/remote.c: Added new command functions. These replace
	  a number of on_event functions, allowing both keys and
	  glade GUI elements to trigger kind of mini scripts.
	  Will probably add more of these and extend to (a)lirc
	  and command line.
	* src/ttxview.c: Removed all key bindings except 0-9.
	  Replaced several functions by remote commands.
	* src/keyboard.c: New file. Added key entry widget based
	  on channel dialog with two changes: Reordered the 'known
	  keys' dialog key table and added a key enter function.
	  Preferences: Added keyboard section to assign commands
	  to keys. Added new one-key bindings. Key events are
	  differently handled now, see README.
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Made toolbar button
	  optional. Added two remote commands to activate, with
	  format parameter.
	* plugins/screenshot/mpeg.c: Added two remote commands
	  to activate. Had to rewrite mpeg_configured() message,
	  crashed due to a glade bug (?).
	* src/audio.c: Volume and mute remote commands.
	* src/callbacks.c: Switch mode/restore/quit remote
	  commands. (Should probably go into main.c)
	* src/channel_editor.c: Replaced key entry dialog.
	  The channel accel stuff is much cleaner now.
	* src/frequencies.c: A little renaming to reduce the
	  confusion between station name and RF channel name.

24.02.2002	Audio <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added preliminary volume +/- buttons. This affects
	  the record line volume using OSS /dev/mixer.

25.02.2002	zapping_setup_fb patch <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: Patch by David Fries.
	  zapping_setup_fb won't run because the .Xauthority is on a nfs mounted
	  directory with the server doing root squash so it can't contact the X
	  server. This patch drops the root privileges when connecting to the X
	  server.

08.02.2002	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Made threads_destroy() block-proof, fixed a td == 0
	  crash (??) in	update_vi_network().
	* src/zmisc.c: -d dumps failure cause of z_pixmap_new_from_file().

05.02.2002	Another mute fix and better KP entering <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/tvengxv.c: tveng_get|set_mute ignored controls bttv
	  mute bug workaround.	   
	* src/osd.c: Added remove timeout callback.
	* src/v4linterface.c: Uses OSD for KP channel number entering.
	* Added "channel number refers to" option.

03.02.2002	Mute fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: zmisc_switch_mode() didn't expect failure of
	  tveng_get_mute(), updated control box before restoring
	  old mute state.
	* src/callbacks.c: on_toggle_muted1_activate() didn't expect
	  failure of tveng_get_mute() and didn't update control box.
	* Added KP channel number entering suggested by Nathan G. Grennan.

24.01.2002	Added @euro charset <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* common/unicode.c: Added support for the ISO-8859-15 locale
	(@euro), and a default when the charset is unknown.
	* src/osd.c: Prefixed correctly VBI_BLUE in sax parsing, etc,
	otherwise they would be ignored.

19.01.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/osd.c: Segv fix in geometry_update().
	* src/zvbi.c: threads_init(), threads_destroy() didn't
	  work correctly on failure.
	* Updated Zapzilla export docs.

18.01.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Error box when the video
	  standard is unknown, used to crash.
	* src/zvbi.c: "Overlay subtitle pages
	  automatically" defaults to FALSE.

14.01.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Restored v4l vbi interface, untested.

13.01.2002	libzvbi <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Ported Zapping from old libvbi to libzvbi, the new
	  standalone version in CVS, module "vbi". Right now only
	  the v4l2 interface works (oops...), ttx search doesn't
	  and the "sample filter" is gone, but the rest seems to
	  be in good shape. Zapping will also compile without
	  libzvbi, disabling all vbi features.

08.01.2002	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* ttxview.c: Page is exported with current reveal state.
	* vbi export: "TODO: TTX export ANSI colors needs improvement"
	  done, now has char set and terminal option, the stupid
	  fg/bg options are gone.

25.12.2001	hide pointer timeout <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* main.c: Hide the pointer after 1.5s, timeout logic.

23.12.2001	fake std <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* tveng1.c: Automatic workaround for v4l api bug, now tunerless
	inputs can set the std when there's a tuner in the card.
	* screenshot: Made the ov511 button polling a
	timeout+thread. Rather inelegant, but we don't have much choice.
	* po: Dumped the ngettext emulation and require the real thing
	(>0.10.36). It won't be a problem except for people building from cvs.

16.12.2001	pl.po updated <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* pl.po: Update by Paweł.

16.12.2001	fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* 176x144: bug in XvPutImage, driver side, deleted.
	* Crash on exit: not recently observed, probably fixed.
	* screenshot.c: Replaced "appx %.2f kB", appx w/2 decimals, yeah.
	* capture.c: zapping --no-xv never cleared window regions
	  not covered by image in case of exposure or image resizing
	  (eg. mpeg plugin).
	* zvbi.c: Fixed "last known station name" bug.
	* export.c: Changed subno separator from '.' to '-'. Problems
	  with new on_electric... but it's probably better to avoid
	  two dots in filenames.

14.12.2001	yet more channel stuff <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* channel_editor.c: Fixed random freq when modifying channel to
	  baseband input (or adding baseband input channel) and then
	  modifying back to tuner. Selecting a channel now sets fine
	  tuning even if "dont change" or baseband channel,
	  so one can switch back and forth without erasing the freq.
	  In clist "dont change" channels are now marked to distinguish
	  from tuner channels.
	* libvbi/lang.c: iconv broken??? Added workaround. 
	* libvbi/exp_html.c: Fixed blink attribute. Replaced ISO-8859-5
	  charset by KOI8-R which seems to be more widely accepted.

13.12.2001	more channel stuff <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* tveng.h: Added tveng_control.def[ault]_value, from api (tveng2.c),
	  or current value (tveng1.c, tvengxv.c). For controls dialog.
	* tveng2.c: Added fake tuner for tests (by default not compiled),
	  fixed in set_input: info->cur_input = input->id;
	* tveng1.c: ditto input->id
	* channel_editor.c: Changing input now activates said input and
	  makes fine tuning sensitive iff tuner. Modified the spinbutton
	  adjustment to allow entering arbitrary frequencies (for
	  add-new-channel). 

12.12.2001	channel stuff <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Moved channel_editor.c z_spinslider into misc.c, merged with
	  mpeg/options.c and made a few improvements. Replaced spinslider
	  in options.c, channel_editor.c and v4linterface.c (which added
	  a reset button to the latter two and a kHz label in channel
	  dialog.
	* v4linterface.c: Changed controls window policy allow_grow to
	  TRUE, to allow wider sliders.

10.12.2001	Solaris portability <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* Many fixes, mainly Solaris portability (thanks to Roger Fujii
	for his help with this).
	* mpeg: run the properties dialog at least once before recording.

9.12.2001	JPEG plugin <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Rewrote jpeg plugin. New attractions: screenshot dialog
	  got a format selector, quality slider and preview (optional),
	  output size estimation, simple deinterlace option, also
	  previewed. Like [Ctrl-S] the image is now grabbed on [S]
	  rather than OK (optional). Added PPM backend. Electrified
	  file name entry, made dialog closing on filename-enter
	  optional.

7.12.2001	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* v4linterface.c: Added new title bar vars $(title), $(rating),
	  contents from program_info[current] (for now CC/XDS only).
	* Added program_info dialog, clone of vbi_info (now Network Info),
	  unified the dialog design.

5.12.2001	caption.c <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed repeated roll-ups may be merged into one.
	  (Not related to the osd bug.)
	* vbi.c: Fixed full stop bug in filter.
	* Fixed vbi_classify_page could mistake current/next
	  program caption language.
	* Added XDS program info event.
	* Added rating pixmaps for program info dialog.

5.12.2001	screenshot.c <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Made Convert_RGB5*5_RGB24 more accurate ((r & 31) * 255 / 31
	  instead of (r & 31) << 3).
	* Cleaned up and slightly accelerated line converters.
	* Primitive beginnings of multiple backends.

3.12.2001	fr.po <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* fr.po: Update by Christian Marillat.
	* callbacks.c: Resize the tv_screen, not the whole window.
	* tveng1.c: Fixed typo when getting the minor device number.
	* zvbi.c: Disable VBI when opening the device fails.

2.12.2001	Fractional pixel problem <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* audio.c: Set configured mixer settings when opening the device.
	* osd.c: Teletubbyfied Mr. Copperfield.

1.12.2001	Mixer et co. <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* tveng: Added tveng_ov511_get_button_state (untested),
	autodetects /proc entry, etc.
	* screenshot: use tveng for querying ov511 status.
	* bookmark.ico: Added, it's a png indeed. Dunno why this, just
	following what the galeon.sf.net web page does.
	* htdocs: Added a "Shortcut Icon" link to the header so bookmarking
	in galeon puts the logo next to the icon (might work in other
	browsers, untested).
	* mixer: Added code to control the mixer, nothing uses it yet
	apart from properties.c
	* properties/audio: Add a simple gui to force a given audio
	recording line and volume, so we always record with the desired
	settings.

27.11.2001	Post-release fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* zapping.spec.in: Included missing zapping_fix_overlay.
	* src/frequencies.c: Added missing UHF for Italy (reported by
	Lorenzo Delana) and Ireland (not sure, but it's probable).
	* screenshot: call plugin_start only once when the ov511 button is
	clicked.

27.11.2001	Screenshot extension <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added function to poll Creative WebCam (ov511) grab button
	  to screenshot plugin, contributed by Sandino Flores Moreno.

22.11.2001	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* v4lx.c: "bad signal -> eof_sent", probably due to exceeding
	  the select timeout limit (can't test mmapped vbi), -> fatal
	  error considered eof. Read interface not affected. Timeouts
	  are ignored now, however a better response is warranted,
	  this code to be revisited at a later date.
	* teletext.c, ttxview.c: TOP index fixes: insufficient pg init,
	  wrong char set, next subp didn't work, char size heisenbug (gcc?).
	* teletext.c, vbi_page_title: Use correct national character set.
	* teletext.c: [default] object invocation did not recursively abort.
	* packet.c, eacem trigger: didn't consider 41st column. First
	  encounter of 'ttx:' trigger, decoding worked out of the box
	  incl nuid and stuff, link not quite.

20.11.2001	Fixes <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* libvbi/caption.c: Fixed CR display update.
	* osd.c: Segv in gdk_draw_rgb_image_dithalign at gdkrgb.c:3057
	  due to missing gdk_rgb_init; Didn't happen when opening prefs
	  first, gdk_rgb_init was called as load image side effect.
	  Copied gdk_rgb_init seq from shaped_caption.c to main.c, correct?

18.11.2001	Completed fast-clicked <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* screenshot: gladeified clicked() dialog.
	* mpeg: Select destination file on clicked signal, as in screenshot.

16.11.2001	Fast variants of screenshot and mpeg <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* screenshot, mpeg: Added fast (Ctrl, no configuration) distinction.
	* main.c: GtkButtons in Z now have a "fast-clicked" signal in
	their class.
	* nl.po: Update by Ime Smits.
	
15.11.2001	nl.po <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* nl.po: Added, contributed by Ime Smits and Reinout van Schouwen.
	* tveng1.c: Reenabled pal-n.
	* properties.c: Remember last open group, added a frame around the
	properties contents, fixed sidebar geometry calculation ("add"
	isn't called for boxes, apparently, even being containers...)

14.11.2001	Killed parrot <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* parrot: Removed from build tree.
	* configure.in: Added --with-gnome-prefix, overrides
	'gnome-config --prefix'
	* prepare_dist: Added optional prefix parameter.
	* channel_editor.c: Sync with glade file.
	* TODO: I think ttx search gui is clear enough, removing from
	here.

12.11.2001	Plugins properties conversion <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* mpeg, lirc, screenshot: Converted properties to the new style.
	* plugins.c: Removed properties handling code, each plugin
	manages its properties now through the properties.h api.

6.11.2001	More properties work <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* audio: Ported to the new properties code.
	* zconf: Added hook_while_alive
	* properties-handler: Dynamic ITV sensitivity.

5.11.2001	Properties almost done <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* properties.c: Finished the shell code.
	* properties-handler.c: Added, it's the handler for Z's properties
	pages. Almost done except for audio backend properties code and
	dynamic ITV sensitivity.

4.11.2001	GUI sweetpill follow-up <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* mpeg.c: Added rte.h version check.
	* Replaced occurences of "Elija un color" outside es.po
	  by "Choose a color".
	* zapping.glade: Moved a few channel dialog widgets.
	* channel_editor.c: Added index and video standard to
	  channel list, moved country, NLSed accelerator modifiers,
	  displays input name instead of country, channel and freq
	  when source is not tuner. Replaced unsafe snprintf(d, n, t)
	  by strncpy. Up and down button insensitive at end of list
	  and after selecting all rows (not always??). The respective
	  next row is moved back in sight on up or down. My spelling
	  gland asked for a change of the freq table names.

4.11.2001	New properties dialog <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* properties.c: New Galeon style properties code. Still under
	construction (and nonfunctional), but I couldn't resist commiting
	:-) Plugins can	be configured in the 'Plugins' dialog.

2.11.2001	GUI sweetpill <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* channel_editor: Rearranged as discussed in the mailing list.
	* gnome_help: Remember to update clips after tveng_restart_everything.
	* zapping_fix_overlay: Script to fix the so common consolehelper
	bug (is it really consolehelper?).

30.10.2001	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* macros: Added as.m4 from automake 1.5, required there but not
	  shipped with previous versions. aclocal 1.5 doesn't abort on
	  double def anymore.
	* mpeg.c: Sets correct frame rate for NTSC.
	* tveng2.c, tvengxv.c: Fixed tveng_enumstd.frame_rate.

26.10.2001	Show/hide pointer <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* zmisc.c: Routines for showing/hiding the pointer, adapted from a
	patch by Jonas Aaberg. Add also a properties entry.
	* zconf: Modified hook semantics to save a lookup.
	* overlay.c: Hooked on the root window events to remove the
	(expensive??) check_timeout. Makes no difference here, but could
	fix some reported bugs about cpu usage in overlay.
	* tveng1.c: Fixed a typo that made working v4l1 devices
	unavailable. Fixed a bug when setting audio controls too (stupid
	confusing ugly v4l api...)

23.10.2001	Mpeg plugin <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added format menu, grte_load|save_context and moved all
	  functions accessing the config file into options.c, with
	  brief descriptions.
	* fifo.c: Added alloc_buffer(*) to struct fifo, renamed
	  recv_full_buffer_timeout to wait_full_buffer_timeout since
	  recv_* never waits.

21.10.2001	CS conversion, qce <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* csconvert.[ch]: Added some unaccelerated rgb colorspace
	conversions.
	* capture.c: Fallbacks to the csconvert routines if no better
	rgb mode is available.
	* Z: Works now with the Logitech Quickcam Express driver (possibly
	with many other quickcams too).
	* properties.c: Only one properties dialog can be opened
	simultaneously.

21.10.2001	Mpeg plugin <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Slider values are rounded down to option step size.
	* Added effective bits/s display.
	* All the video options seem to work now.

19.10.2001	Mpeg plugin <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* tveng1.c: Added mp1e/video/v4l.c timestamping method to get
	  sufficently accurate time. Prerequisities:
	* tveng.h: Added frame rate field to tveng_enumstd, will be set
	  in tveng1.c, tveng2.c, tvengxv.c.
	* tveng1.c: Fixed PAL-M incorrectly assumed 625/50.
	* tveng2.c: Replaced strstr(enumstd.std.name, "ntsc"); Unless
	  the driver is borken the w/h info is more reliable deduced
	  from enumstd.std.framelines. May have incorrectly assumed
	  PAL-M, PAL-60 are 625/50.
	* esd.c, oss.c: Added mp1e esd.c, oss.c timestamping, tested, works.
	* arts.c: Added mp1e esd.c timestamping, untested. (Not installed
	  on my box.)
	* src/properties.c: Complained "no plugin accepts..." (arg1 == 0),
	  moved handlers[i].apply() loop under default: as it was supposedly
	  intended.
	* mpeg plugin: Ducks are back in a row, but it needs some more
	  testing and polishing.

18.10.2001	Easy stuff <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* v4linterface.c: Fixed an stupid bug in control saving, appears
	to work nicely now.
	* exp-html.c: Replaced <blink> by text-decoration: blink;

17.10.2001	Video output abstraction <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* x11stuff.c, video_xv.c: Virtualized all xvz_ operations,
	allowing for other kinds of YUV acceleration apart from XVideo.

14.10.2001	Audio recording abstraction <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* audio.c: Audio recording abstraction so we can reuse the code
	between plugins and make it easier to configure.
	* esd.c, oss.c, arts.c: Some backends. Still ![finished|tested].
	* properties.c: Added the property_handler logic, allows for
	properties managing decentralization.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Created new properties cathegory, audio.

10.10.2001	Swap chan up/down <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* v4linterface.c: Made the PgUp/Down behaviour configurable, it
	was counterintuitive for some people. This is provisional, just
	till we have the generical bindings stuff in place.

09.10.2001	Requested controls gui polishing <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* v4linterface.c: Added a spinbutton to the slider in the video
	controls for finer tuning.
	

08.10.2001	Context menu for plugins <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* plugins.c: Added plugin_process_popup_menu.
	* plugins/mpeg/mpeg.c: Add it to the context menu.
	* fifos: added recv_full_buffer_timeout to solve problems in
	vbi_close.

08.10.2001	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Changed REQUIRED_RTE_VERSION to 0.4cvs.
	* plugins/mpeg/options.c: Resynced with rte.h.

01.10.2001	Channel editor improvements <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* channel_editor.c: Now the freq saved with the channel is the one
	set in the slider bar, not the current freq. Also, add the option
	to enter custom freqs.

29.09.2001	tvscreen gtkda again <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: Make tv_screen a GtkDrawingArea again to
	fix GtkFixed expose problems with TTX.
	* osd.c: Subtitles toggle only affects CC/TTX, not osd_render*
	text. Same goes for osd_clear.

28.09.2001	OSD complete <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* osd.c: Added osd_render, keep correct ratio for OSD text,
	timeout, added zmodel_changed as needed. Appears to work reliably.
	* v4linterface.c, callbacks.c: Added OSD notification for Audio
	Mute/Unmute and channel change (when Fullscreen).
	* TODO: Cleaned up a bit, moved some things to 0.6.3 to have
	another release soon.

26.09.2001	OSD fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* osd.c: Fixed 'flicker in FS', 'off-by-one', 'extra
	size_allocates'	and 'prolly more' :-) 'Missing words' is still a
	mistery.

25.09.2001	OSD rewrite <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* osd.c: Rewritten, now osd windows are subwindows of the TV
	screen, still some bugs (flicker in FS, missing words ???,
	off-by-one error in y coords when doing roll_up, extra
	size_allocates, prolly more).
	You can get a feeling of the sgml renderer pressing 'o'.

21.09.2001	mpeg properties fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* mpeg.c: Fixed options frame deletion (objects are created with a
	floating ref, attaching them to a parent makes this ref be 1, when
	the parent is destroyed the widget is unref'ed, and thus
	destroyed, no need to call gtk_object_ref/unref ourselves).
	* plugins.c: First load plugins under $home, then global.

19.09.2001	more renderer work <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* osd.c: Make the renderer honour <i>, <u>, <b> and the colour
	tags. Cleanup of the code, now the renderer is integrated with the
	SAX parser and no charset translation is needed.
	* release a new updated package with the .spec hopefully working
	for RH (the new OSD code is disabled in here).

18.09.2001	SGML renderer <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* osd.c: Wrote sgml gdk renderer, sgml tags still not
	recognised (but that's easy).
	* zmisc.c: Added hide button on status bar messages.
	* zapping.spec.in: Now it should work under RH too, thanks to
	Mark (mark at extension2.freeserve.co.uk) for his help with this.

17.09.2001	OSD properties <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* osd.c: Finally(?) decided to try the gdk way, added properties
	dialog handling.
	* fr.po: Update by Christian.
	* ttxview.c: Fixed a typo that broke the automatic overlaying of
	subtitles, treat pages with TRANSPARENT background as subtitles too.
	* Makefile.am: Added autogen.sh to the distro, so prepare_dist.sh
	works out of the box.
	* ru.po: Removed, unmaintained for a number of releases.
	
16.09.2001	SGML->attr_char <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* zvbi.c: Wrote a first version of the SGML->attr_char converter,
	will improve.

13.09.2001	bounds checking <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* libvbi/teletext.c: Added bounds checking for enhance, could
	segfault under certain circunstances.
	* ttxview.c: Search gui touches.

11.09.2001	mpeg plugin audio options <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg: Added dynamic audio options using the new
	  rte_option API. Unfinished, won't work as expected yet.

10.09.2001	automatic overlaying of subtitles <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* ttxview: Subtitle pages opened in the main window can now be
	opened automatically (configurable).
	* tveng.c: Fixed xv control multigenesis bug.
	* tveng[12].c: Removed the ioctl tests, they did no good.
	* pl.po: Updated (Paweł)

03.09.2001	fifo hang fix <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* fifo.c: rem_consumer could under certain circumstances leave
	  unconsumed buffers on the virtual full queue, fixed.

02.09.2001	sv translation <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* sv.po: Commited Swedish translation, contributed by
	  Henrik Isacsson. Many thanks!

01.09.2001	libvbi <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* decoder.c: NTSC requires valid line numbers, added vbi_ prefixes.
	* exp-html.c: Added missing language id's, replaced open_memstr.
	* export.c: Added vbi_export_open parameter "reveal".
	* v4lx.c: Moved printv above ENABLE_V4L.

	* tables.c updated, cleanup in cache.c|h, removed -D_GNU_SOURCE.
	* zapping.desktop: Added comment translations from *.po.
	* ttxview.c: Page up/down wasn't connected, changed page num
	  format to %03x.02x to avoid widget resizing. 

31.08.2001	Channel editor usability <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* src/channel_editor: Do not tune all channels when there are
	many of them selected, smarter modify/add when activating the
	channel name GtkEntry, keep selection et al when modifying.
	* zapping_setup_fb: Reverted to the old bpp detection.
	* configure.in: require ngettext in AM_GNU_GETTEXT (i18ed
			plural forms).
	* fr.po: Updated translation (Christian).

30.08.2001	Select audio device <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* gettext: Applied patch from Paweł for handling plural i18ed
		strings correctly.

	* 0.6.0 released, include prepare_dist.sh in the distro.
		Do not compile gen_conv.s if there's no MMX/GAS

23.08.2001	capture with different bpl <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* capture.c, tveng: Capture now accepts frames with different
	bytes per line but the same format otherwise.
	* zapping_setup_fb: Made PAM support work for me again.
	* capture.c: Correct format.pixformat set for YVU420 XV bundles.
	* zapping.spec.in, configure.in: Made stupid rpm's out there work
	fine. Now making 0.6.0 should be just running prepare_dist.sh.

	many times the same flag. Use gnome-config --prefix instead of
	ac_default_prefix.

	<>. The rest will come later.

21.08.2001	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Modified a few, um, not so clear labels (en) in the channel
	  dialog.

        * vbi_format_page bugs: Not pg->row = display_rows; Wrote
	  glyph 0 instead of 0x20 in 41st column; Didn't write spacing
	  attr double height lower row, probable cause of the
	  vbi_fetch_vt_page segv.
	* po: Added emacs coding hints. How's this coded btw?

18.08.2001	pl translation <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* pl.po: Commited pl translation, contributed by Paweł Sakowski.

	* zmisc.c: Fixed button hor/vert aligning in toolbars when the

	changing inputs, standards or channels.

17.08.2001	many channels <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	channels, add inputs and standards to the context menu.

16.08.2001	fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* zvbi.c: Reduced the number of fetch_page calls. Better now?
	  (mhs: Z still calls fetch for notify_clients/rolling_header
	   even in pure capture mode. Purpose?)
	* vbi_fetch_vt_page: Added memset(pg, 0, sizeof(*pg)), otherwise
	segfault when drawing the page if pg is initially bogus data.
	* capture.c: Fixes, but mc still breaks the mpeg plugin. Spent the
	whole day tracking this down, nothing so far :-(

16.08.2001	Zapzilla gui <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* ttxview.c: Removed export dir field, Zapzilla now
	  remembers the path last entered. z_build_path is

	  file entry "electric", ie. the proposed file name is
	  automagically appended.
	* search.c, ttxview.c: Added regular expression option.

16.08.2001	libvbi et al <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* exp-html.c: Added color option, fixed anchor insertion.

15.08.2001	libvbi et al <mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* glade: Removed the gettextized "labelxx" and the like.
	* list.h: rem_node() returns NULL if node is not member of
	  the list. Fast removing w/o check under unlink_node().
	* fifo.c: rem_producer/consumer() safe to call after
	  adding failed. (More changes ahead.)
	* vbi.c: Restored test filter.
	* teletext.c: Fixed SWR p570 DRCS bug. Added enhancement
	  header-only shortcut as suggested by spec.
	* zvbi.c: Fixed off-by-one error (41st column) updating RTC
	  in rolling_header(), and no RTC from a page not marked
	  for rolling (was a problem on MTV ger; arguable, let's see).

	* help/man/: Man pages (Christian Marillat).

30.06.2001	yuv filters <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* yuv2rgb_mmx.c: Uses Michael's autogenerated filters now.
	* gen_conv.[sh]: added.
	* x11stuff.c, zapping_setup_fb: improve screen depth detection.

28.06.2001	--disable-v4l <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in, v4lx.c, tveng1.c, tveng2.c: Added --disable-v4l
	option, lets all the V4L specific stuff out of the compilation,
	for Solaris.

23.06.2001	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* gcc 3.0 fixes (nothing serious)

22.06.2001	bug fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* callbacks.c: fixed channel ordering, reported by n0mada@terra.es.
	* zconf.c: Fixed double free(), used xmlFree instead of g_free
	where appropiate.
	* fullscreen.c: Made channel accelerators work in fullscreen.

15.06.2001	alirc, plugin properties <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* src/plugin_common.h: Made plugin_add_properties a gboolean,
	returns TRUE if the plugins will add anything. gpb arg can be NULL.
	* plugins/alirc: integrated patch by Sjoerd Simons.
	* src/remote.c: Added load_page.

8.06.2001	color dialog <garetxe@users.sf.net>

28.05.2001	alirc plugin <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/alirc: 'Another lirc plugin', by Sjoerd Simons
	<sjoerd@air.luon.net>. Thanks! :-)

27.05.2001	MPEG fixes <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/mpeg.c: Works now if Z's yuv pixformat is YUYV and
	capture isn't buffered push. Core when buffered push and lock with
	YVU420 (probably RGB too, untested). Probably bugs in plugin.c
	and capture.c.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Configurable Q/S tradeoff when doing the
	scaling of the TTX pages.

25.05.2001	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* plugins/screenshot: YVU420, TTX capture.

24.05.2001	<mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/lirc/lirc.c: lirc_page fixed in plugin_add_properties

24.05.2001	Rolling headers <garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Rolling headers support (just the time field for the
	moment).

19.05.2001	Fullscreen <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/fullscreen.c: Made fullscreen usable under many heads.	

16.05.2001	<mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

14.05.2001	--yuv-format flag <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/main.c, capture.c, x11stuff.c: Added CLO [command line
	option :-)] for deciding between YUYV and YVU420.
	* src/fullscreen.c: No longer grabs the keyboard.
	* src/videodev*: moved to /common, made libvbi use these versions
	too for consistency.

13.05.2001	CC classify gui <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Added gui for the CC classification, added
	'Subtitle Page' VBI property and removed toolbar spinbutton.
	* BUGS: Investigated problems with bundle_data under V4L1, they
	were due to a bug in bttv support for interlaced YUV420P. Maintainer
	informed.

12.05.2001	YVU420 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/capture.c: Defaulted to YVU420P for capture, plugins need
	to be adapted. Added display of _DATA bundles, using yuv2rgb.
	* tveng: Added assume_yvu to work around V4L1 API limitations.
	* yuv2rgb_mmx: Added lacking "emms" to reenable math coprocessor.

11.05.2001	did some things from TODO <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c: Channels can have an arbitrary order now.
	* configure.in: Remove --disable-ordering flag.
	* src/zvbi.c: Added a verboser message when vbi fails to open.
	* src/ttxview.c: Go back from TTX.
	
5.05.2001	remote(get_channel_info) <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/remote.c: added get_channel_info call.
	* common/fifo: "slow consumer" killing code, unfinished, breaks
	some things.

4.05.2001	mpeg plugin improvements <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/mpeg: Adapted to new bundled capture. Now it's possible
	to record mpeg's without XVideo backend scaler.

2.05.2001	Config options <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/capture.c: Fixed, so plugins can work again. Made capture
	size under XVideo configurable.

1.05.2001	New capture code <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/capture.c: Rewrote capture code using fifos, etc. Appears to
	use less CPU with XV scaling (identically 0 :-)). Oppps, and
	plugins won't work either, will fix tomorrow.

30.4.2001	xvzImage <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/x11stuff.c: Moved XvImage support here, made easier to use.

28.4.2001	XV_SIGNAL_STRENGTH <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tvengxv.c: Added support for this atom, allows for automatic
	channel searching. Now let's see if the v4l.c maintainer in XFree
	accepts my patch, and the rest of the world sees this too :-)
	* src/zmisc.c: Reduce unnecessary open/close couples.

27.4.2001	TVeng thread-safe <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng.c: Added a per-device mutex, made tveng.c lock,
	unlock it as necessary. Rewrote some common code as #macros.

25.4.2001	--command switch <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/remote.c, src/main.c: Added --command line switch, currently
	just "set_channel". Use with 'zapping -c "set_channel BBC"'

24.4.2001	trigger gui <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zvbi.c, properties, .glade: Started trigger gui.
	* eacem_icon, atvef_icon: Moved to pixmaps. 

7.04.2001	mpeg plugin <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* rte: rte_stop closes properly, buffers used for push are
	send_empty'ed, lots of fixes and tuning. Removed rgb support, it
	was nonfunctional.
	* fifos: Proper refcounting.
	* plugins/mpeg/: Encodes, needs a lot of work though.

5.04.2001	libvbi, help <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Finished trigger rewrite.
	* Some work in /help.

3.04.2001	overlay+osd fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* overlay, tveng, osd: Made them play nice together under V4L[12].
	* src/tveng: Print more verbose messages if no DGA present.
	* src/tvengxv.c: Made it work without DGA.
	* src/osd.c, fullscreen: Centered subtitles in fullscreen even if
	VidMode changed.

2.04.2001	accelerators <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* controls: Added accelerators for hiding/showing menu bars
	(Ctrl+H), control box (Ctrl+C).
	* es.po: Updated.
	* src/ttxview.c: Added TTX subtitles selection to the popup menu.

1.04.2001	screenshot gladefied <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/screenshot: uses libglade now, added accelator for saving
	(Ctrl+s).
	* src/capture.c: send_event = False. Appears to be faster in some
	setups.

31.3.2001	mcfifos fixed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fifo: Rewrote most multi-consumer part of fifos, rte
	works again :-)
	* mp1e: 'make dist' functional
	* libvbi/v4lx.c: Minimized delay on joining the thread.

30.3.2001	libvbi <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Teletext page classification.

28.3.2001	libvbi <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* New weblink event for ITV and Z2W.
	* packet.c: Added preliminary decoding of "zap2web", TTX based
	  equv. of CC-ITV, went on air at CeBit last week.
	UPDATE: Just got the EACEM prop "zap2web" is based on, this
	  feature is on freeze for a rewrite.
	* packet.c: Added page classification (program related,
	  subtitles, number of subpages etc). Not reliable yet.

25.3.2001	channel=f(bookmark) <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Selecting a bookmark can tune the current channel.
	* libvbi/v4lx.c: Added some cancellation points, so the thread is
	always joinable.

25.3.2001	ttxview/libvbi <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ttxview.c & exp_txt.c: Improved wrapping selection of double-h/w/s
	  characters.
	* v4lx.c has a buffered fifo, timestamps are valid, out-of-sync
	  function restored.
	* Added text colour levels (brightness, contrast), no gui.
	  Primarily an improvement when scaling < 1x.
	* Page event flags rolling header.
	* Added resize options 720x576 and 352x288 (ITU-R 601 devices).

24.3.2001	channel editor <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c: Completed new channel code.

23.3.2001	channels <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: Mostly finished new channels design. Lacks gui
	polishing, but works.
	* src/zmisc.c: Added convenience functions for GtkOptionMenu.
	* tveng: Added hash for input/standards.

22.3.2001	libxml2 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Better libxml detection, libxml2 support.
	* ttxview.c: Fixed segv in expose. Added www.* addresses to #url# mask.
	* Started channel => channel+input+standard work.

21.3.2001	ttxview.c <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* frequencies.c: Added PAL-China, ripped from XawTV. Isn't GPL
	  a wonderful thing?
	* libvbi: Rewrite of export api finished.
	* ttxview.c: The export menu builds dynamically now, the only
	  visible change is the dialog title "Export <format>".
	* ttxview.c: Replaced the string export hack by mem fp.
	* ttxview.c: Simplified the selection routines, added
	  wrap-around mode cf. xterm.
	* de.po update.

20.3.2001	0.5.92 released <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/overlay.c: Do not clean screen with cards that support
	chromakeying. Reported to work.
	* fifos: Fixed gross bug. Amazing it didn't have zillions of side
	effects... but i cannot join mux thread from rte yet, getting
	weirder and weirder...
	* tveng, src/main.c: --dword-align option. Has some uses for
	broken drivers, but disabled by default.
	* libvbi/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: Added $(UNICODE_CFLAGS),
	that should fix the build problems for people with unicode.h not
	in an standard location.

18.3.2001	Chroma <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added chroma support for overlay, dunno if it works.
	* plugins/lirc/lirc.c: Cleanup, fixed a bug.

18.3.2001	TTX <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed spurious blinking bug in level 2.5 decoder.
	* Export filename and HTML/PNG title includes station name
	  if known.
	* HTML export adds anchors for http/ftp/email links.

17.3.2001	Export beautification <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Changed export file GtkEntry to GnomeFileEntry,
	and now uses zconf to keep preferences. Made it a bit wider.
	* configure.in: Released 0.5.91 (bugfixes) today, bumped version
	to 0.6.0cvs.
	* libvbi/lang.h, exp-*: Added gettext support to export.
	* src/ttxview.c: Fixed ENIAC bug in txt mode.	

16.3.2001	TTX export <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Export options interface now tveng controls style.
	* Rewrote export dialog. Not completely satisfied, but well.
	* Added email keywords (a), (at).
	* Added vbi_network XDS/CNI unique id.

16.3.2001	pam workarounds <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Added --disable-pam option, apparently some pam
	versions are broken, so they cannot exec zsfb properly.
	* src/mmx.c: Strangely enough, the TryAMD label fails to compile
	under gcc 2.95.3 (report by Olivier Perron), applied the patch he
	sent to work around this.

15.3.2001	more clean calls for Overlay <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/overlay.c: Added some extra clean() calls (unmapping,
	stopping), this should fix those ugly pixels left.
	* src/main.c: Added a set of fallbacks in case /dev/video0 doesn't
	open, should make devFS work too.
	* src/capture.c: Capture mode speedup with XVideo scaler (1% cpu
	usage, whew!).

14.3.2001	DPMS in Xext <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Applied patch by Dirk Meul to search for DPMS
	functions in DPMS in -lXext in case -Xdpms fails.

10.3.2001	osd rough edges <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* osd.c: No flicker even w/o XVideo, knows about showing/hiding
	the main window.
	* help/de: German translation of index.html, by Carsten Menke.
	* src/osd.c: Fixed "ttx subtitles no update" bug.

9.3.2001	Cleanup <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated de.po

8.3.2001	Fullscreen <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/fullscreen: Added, holds the code for fullscreen mode. Added
	the hability to do OSD correctly in fullscreen without XVideo
	PutVideo.

4.3.2001	TTX subtitles gui <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: Added some provisional GUI for TTX
	subtitles, but thinking about better ways to do it.

3.3.2001	Network info <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zvbi.c: Added network info dialog.
	* src/ttxview.c: Fixed a bug with with TTX restart.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Reorganized a bit the VBI properties to
	make the dialog take less space.

2.3.2001	VBI open/close <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Made the vbi object notify clients (TTXView) about being closed,
	this allows for clean start/restart of TTX.
	* plugins/lirc: Bugfixes (one of them introduced by me ;-P)
	* libvbi/v4lx.c: Made it accept a given_fd parameter, rationale:
	guess_v4l tries to open a device to query state, let it know
	that we already own it (otherwise v4l1 drivers will refuse
	re-opening it). Now just fails for me reopening the vbi device under
	XVideo and v4l1, good enough i think.

1.3.2001	Lirc <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/lirc: Added infrared support, written by Marco
	Pfattner. Thanks a lot!

28.2.2001	zconfhook <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zconf.c: Added gconfish notification mechanism, now the vbi
	device can be opened/closed using the properties dialog, V4L open
	fails.

27.2.2001	osd <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* osd.c: Pipe replaced fifo/timer event queue. Moved
	  rendering to exp_gfx.c, modified ttx render funcs
	  for Teletext overlay. Works nicely.

26.2.2001	TTX <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added VTX export module, rationale <http://alevt.listbot.com/
	  cgi-bin/subscriber?Act=view_message&list_id=alevt&msg_num=188&start_num=>
	* Cleaned up events, made caption a genuine event.

25.2.2001	caption ipc <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Renamed conceal button to reveal. Is reveal on all
	  RC's and TTX refers to it as 'reveal function'.
	  Also renamed all identifiers for consistency.
	* station: Added VPS support, fixed cni priority.
	* caption.c, osd.c: Changed render()/clear()/
	  roll_up() calls to caption event, fetch_cc, and
	  tracking of changes.
	* caption.c: All double buffered now.

23.2.2001	XV fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tvengxv.c: Added support in the controller for fullscreen
	XVideo (easier than expected).
	* XV: Fixed flicker because of extra preview_on, _off calls.
	* src/ttxview.c, src/zvbi.c: Conceal option.
	* src/osd.c: OSD works in fullscreen mode too.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Option for turning CC display on/off.

21.2.2001	caption integrated <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* caption.c, osd.c: Integrated caption display into the program,
	it works great :-) Flickers more than necessary when adding
	text to the same row, could be solved by passing a starting_row to
	the render function, thus avoiding the need to remove the
	currently drawn portion of the line to draw again the same.

20.2.2001	TTX <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* export.c: Zero 'struct export *' on allocation, caused segv
	when pasting text.
	* zvbi.c: Better patch generation, corrects errors caused by interp.

20.2.2001	caption <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed 'double height acute vowels' bug.
	* Caption decoder is online, minor tweaks here and there.
	* lang.c: translates caption glyphs.

19.2.2001	blink <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

        * Modified phase from 50:50 to 75:25, is easier to read,
	  and cycle time 1.5 s.
	* libvbi/exp-gfx.c: correction, flash to background.

18.2.2001	blink <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TTX: Blinking chars now blink, but needs further work. How
	should the blink be done?
	* libvbi/exp-gfx.c: Added rowstride parameter, hope i didn't break
	too many things ;-P

17.2.2001	osd <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* osd.c: Created. Has the required functionality for integrating
	CC. No smooth scrolling but will work nicely without XV.
	* tveng: Made it a bit more fault tolerant, tries to restart
	capture after failed S_INPUT and S_STD.
	* main.c: Killed the demiurgical fscking inmortal
	i-resize-magically-when-*I*-desire-because-i'm-THE-MAIN-WINDOW
	bug... for some time at least, awaiting its certain resurrection.
	* error_console.c: Created, avoids creating too many dialogs in
	broken systems and allows copy&paste of the exact error messages
	(so hopefully i won't get more "it breaks saying something i
	didn't bother to look to" bug reports :-))
	* osd.c: Added interface (cc_* routines) to be called from the CC
	decoder threads (untested).
	* zmisc.c: Z works now in environments with XVideo but no
	functional video device.
	
16.2.2001	TTX export <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* removed all vt_page references from ttxview, zvbi. This is
	  a private libvbi structure now: vbi_event->pgno | user input
	  -> vbi_fetch_page -> fmt_page -> buffer, export, render.
	  Rationale: Raw data is useless for GUI, need not export
	  the rat tail of vt_page substructures and definitions.
	  No cache access outside libvbi, client can't maintain
	  pointers into a dynamically allocated & updated cache
	  or feed back outdated local copies of raw data.

15.2.2001	Copy (pixmaps) <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: The selection is now exported as a pixmap too
	(can be pasted into xpaint, for example)
	* src/tveng2.c: Support for driver private controls (untested)
	* libvbi/exp-gfx.c: Partial (region) rendering.

13.2.2001	TTX export <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* added aspect option to ppm/png export
	* removed vt_page* from struct fmt_page

11.2.2001	Copy (text) <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Exports the selection as TEXT to the primary
	clipboard (Emacs, X apps) and to CLIPBOARD (GTK apps). X sucks.
	* libvbi/exp-txt.c: Added a string export filter.

10.2.2001	Visual selection finished <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Visually selecting the region works flicker free,
	lacks the export filter to clipboard.
	* src/tveng2.c: dummy s_win on startup, avoid g_win failing later
	on because no window set.
	* configure.in, src/x11stuff.c: Deactivate DPMS when going fullscreen.
	* libvbi/v4lx.c (guess_v4l): Try with /dev/video0 before
	traversing dev, 1s startup speedup in the common case.
	
9.2.2001	CP work <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Visual selection works, needs to get flicker free
	(easy, but time consuming). Fixed SEGV (button_release not
	disconnected).
	* src/tvengxv.c: Fixed cur_input setting, added index field to
	tveng_enum_input.
	* src/tveng.c: Applied patch to do normalized comparing of
	standards and inputs (Magnus).

8.2.2001	gnome-help-browser <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: Action for links. Configure with gnomecc,
	"URL handler". Started copy&paste work, selecting doesn't work
	properly yet, but i need to sleep 8-P

7.2.2001	Zapzilla navigation <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* new add_bcd and carry fix in on_ttxview_key_press()
	* modified links, double width/size safe and http/ftp/email,
	  action tbd.
	* unified CC/WST attr_char, added format.h.
	* moved conceal/reveal into render functions; Need a reveal button.

5.2.2001	Set input <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Applied patch by Magnus Sandin to keep input whilst
	switching modes.
	* zapping_setup_fb/Makefile.am, zapping.spec.in: Applied patch by
	Tim Powers to fix build process.

3.2.2001	ZSFB goes PAM <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb: Uses PAM if available, as explained by Tim
	Powers.
	* plugins: they get installed now under $(prefix)/lib/zapping/plugins,
	that's more polite, according to informed sources :-)

2.2.2001	/dev/video0 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* s/dev\/video/dev\/video0/g: rationale: In RH 7.1 beta (Fisher),
	/dev/video is a dir. Patch sent by Tim Powers, thanks :-)
	* Trying to get Z running under 2.4.1, BTTV. The driver appears to
	be broken (mmap fails), haven't tested with xawtv yet.

31.1.2001	Accel keys <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/main.c, channel_editor.c: Finished accel keys. The key
	list takes too much ram (custom widget?)
	* configure.in: Used unicode-config for checking unicode.
	* glade/: Added right-click access to some useful sizes.
	* callbacks.c: Put the tuned channels in a submenu if more than 7.

31.1.2001	Zapzilla <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* export.c: rewrote enhancement decoder, didn't scale. Should
		support all of 2.5, 3.5 now. Fragments of a TOP index.
	* vbi.c: fixes

30.1.2001	Key syms <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/keysysms.h: busy, just putting up list of known keys.

27.1.2001	Channel accels <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade, src/channel_editor.c: Added support for
	attaching accelerators to channels, unfinished.

25.1.2001	Old cruft removed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: Moved vbi_v4l[2].c to the attic, not longer needed,
	updated README.

24.1.2001	minor tweaks <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Hide the pointer in fullscreen mode.
	* src/overlay.c: Fixed tv_screen geometry changed handling.
	* src/callbacks.c: Recompute gometry after modifying (hide, show,
	resize) toolbar and menu.
	* src/callbacks.c: Support for mouse wheel buttons 4 (channel up)
	and 5 (channel down).

24.1.2001	Zapzilla <mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* caption.c: added xds and itv decoder
	* caption.c: various caption fixes (still unfinished)

30.12.2000	Faster rendering, bookmarks <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: [<<][<][>][>>]
	* src/ttxview.c: Added bookmarks. They cannot be removed yet (edit

	* src/zmisc.c: Got rid of redundant malloc, free's, it should
	be faster now.

28.12.2000	YAGR <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: Yet another GUi revamp. We are getting
	closer to perfection :-)
	* src/ttxview.c: Made the prev, next subpage buttons traverse the
	cache of pages. We probably need some way to request a given subpage.

	* src/tvengxv.c: I shouldn't read that fast...

20.12.2000	TTXView, T thread <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ttxview.c: All the difficult things are done by now, lacks
	history.
	* src/zvbi.c: Created T thread as discussed, loads of old code
	need to be removed now.
	* src/tvengxv.c (tvengxv_get_tune): Fixed(?) a bug, the pointer

	* src/tvengxv.c, src/callbacks.c, src/main.c, src/overlay.c: First
	working XVideo code. It almost works, except for some glitches,
	and that some parts (mainly overlay) are a compendium of gross
	hacks that should be rewritten cleanly.

24.11.2000	Russian glyphs, XVideo <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: Added font3 and font4, they are the Russian
	glyphs. Contributed by Sergey Nikulin.

	* src/tvengxv.h: Created.

23.11.2000	More XVideo, tveng1 fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tvengxv.c: Some more work into this, emulating TVeng api using

	inputs.

22.11.2000	XVideo work <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	minimal work by now: attach, describe, close, init.
	* /me: I wish i had time to sleep... a day with 48 hours would
	be fine too... All day in the Uni, then code :-(

21.11.2000	tveng modularized <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/ru.po: Added Russian translation

17.11.2000	V4L VBI support <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: tries to open the vbi device as V4L2. If it fails, uses
	V4L instead.
	* po/es.po: Updated.
	* src/main.c (main): startup_vbi called after setting the input
	and the standard to work around bttv2 locking.

15.11.2000	V4L2 VBI support <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: Brought up-to-date with alevt 1.6.0, added V4L2-aware
	code. This will be replaced in the future by Michael's decoder.

	driver.
	* src/tveng: Use seconds as the timestamp unit, it's a double now.

31.10.2000	More work on Xv <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	YUYV).
	* src/main.c:
	* src/zmisc.c: The capture code now goes into capture.c

	latest videodevX.
	* src/capture.c: Some preliminar Xv code has been written.

	* src/tveng.c: Now the debug level can be changed using
	tveng_set_debug_level.

	* plugins/mpeg: rte is now ready, i'm starting the wrapper plugin.
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Modified as necessary

14.10.2000	XGetScreenSaver <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/x11stuff.c: Use XGetScreenSaver and friends to modify the
	screensaver, but it doesn't appear to work yet :-(

5.10.2000	Russian frequency table <garetxe@eusers.sourceforge.net>

	* src/frequencies.c: Added russian frequency table, donated by

	aceleration supported.
	* src/mmx.h:
	* src/mmx.c: MMX detecting and handling helper functions.
	* src/overlay.{ch}: Overlay handling code, completely
	rewritten. Now it works perfectly, just a bit of necessary
	flicker.

	GDK in the rest of Zapping for the sake of clarity.
	* src/tveng2.c: Some fixes to make it work with the newest bttv2
	and videodevX.

	device on success (if not configured with --disable-tveng-debug)
	* src/tveng.c: Kernel 2.4.0test8's bttv makes the program hang if
	the given width and height aren't valid, fixed (was '/dev/dsp bug')
	* src/tveng.c: Added the option to tveng_device_info_new to use a
	standard norm is the input we are going to switch to is tunerless
	(so it defaults to PAL).
	* src/main.c: Added the command line option to control the default
	norm (--tunerless-norm, -n)

14.9.2000	Kernel 2.4.0test8 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* /box: Installed the new kernel, a number of problems have arisen
	with Zapping. I can reproduce now the /dev/dsp bug! I don't have a
	clue of the cause, though :-)
	* /box: NOTE: Some user related that the problem disappeared after
	installing Gerd's bttv over the 2.4.0test8's one. Check.
	* src/sound.c: bugfix, even when esd failed to open the device,
	startup_sound returned succeeded.

	* src/plugins.c: The plugin_sample struct no longer contains a
	GdkImage.
	* plugins/screenshot: Now it saves the current teletext page too.
	* src/strnatcmp: Like strcmp and strcasecmp, but perform natural
	ordering of strings with numbers (1, 2, 3, .., 8, 9, 10, 11)
	* src/strnatcmp.c: fall back to str[case]cmp if they compare the
	same in natural order.

08.9.2000	History improved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: txtcontrols redesigned, now it only shows
	the visited pages, not page + subpage. For using both, a tree
	would be better.
	* src/zvbi.c: Added a web-browser-like history, and a visited
	pages list. It's easier to navigate now. Added fast navigation
	("color" navigation, FLOF), and subpage/page recognision.

07.9.2000	History implemented <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/txtcontrols.c: Previous, next work for pages and subpages,
	history is saved when setting pages.

06.9.2000	VBI integrated <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: VBI has been integrated into the GUI.
	* src/callbacks.c: Added code for switching to VBI

	when neccessary)
	* pixmaps/vt_loading*: Two images (~11K) created for when the
	requested page isn't available.
	* src/channel_editor.c: Uses VBI for getting the station names.
	* src/main.c: Added config setting for saving the VBI state.
	* src/txtcontrols.c: Created, manages the VBI GUI.

05.9.2000	Bpp fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb: Now accepts command line --bpp option
	* src/zvbi.c: Does most of the work. Fetches, renders and scales
	automagically teletext pages. Depends on GdkPixbuf to work.
	* src/properties.c: Now the VBI properties are modificable.

04.9.2000	Bug fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng[12].c: Fixes in the fullscreen mode, it had errors
	related to non-functional DGA drivers. Now most of the
	functionality goes into the VidMode extension, that usually works.

03.9.2000	Project structure changes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: It's a bit cleaner now, and commited to CVS
	* src/zvbi.c: Gets the date and the name on each header/xpacket
	* configure.in: Not having -lpng is not longer fatal, conditional
	plugin build, [optional] GdkPixbuf support added (i will need it
	for the VBI plugin)

01.9.2000	VBI support added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: Added support for VBI (stolen from alevt)
	* src/zvbi.c: Swallow support and encapsulation added

25.8.2000	mode switch when needed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/screenshot: Now switchs to capture mode automagically
	when overlay. Doesn't switch back, though.
	* src/zmisc.c: ShowBox now accepts parameters (like sprintf,
	printf and friends)

24.8.2000	back to work <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/fr.po: Updated the french translation (Christian Marillat)
	* src/callbacks.c: The focus change no longer makes the overlay
	refresh (was a bit visually unpleasant)
	* src/tveng[12].c: Added a configure option to avoid initial
	channel and standard selection.

27.7.2000	mode switching <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Added a routine for switching modes correctly.
	
23.7.2000	Misc bug fixing <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Fixed the segfault when quitting (i believe so, at
	least).
	* src/tveng.c: Fixed some memleaks with the X code, and made it
	restore the VidMode correctly when returning from fullscreen.
	* src/zconf.c: Fixed the problems with the help being opened by
	Mozilla - it was a mem-leak, g_get_home_dir returns a static
	string, and I was g_free'ing it.
	* plugins/screenshot: It now checks for capture mode before starting.
	* help/C: I updated the docs and the screenshots.
	
22.7.2000	Windowed preview working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Fixed the last bugs with it except one, that i
	would need to get events from the root window to fix (and I don't
	want to). You could call it a "feature" ;-) Did I tell that
	windowed preview sucks? There is a bug with it that i'm trying to
	reproduce (a SIGSEGV when exitting)
	* src/tveng2.c: Fixed a bug with clipping rectangles. The struct
	wasn't built correctly for more than one rectangle.
	* everything: The windowed mode has been integrated in the program
	(TVENG_CAPTURE_WINDOW mode).
	* src/zmisc.c: I think the SIGSEGV previously mencioned is fixed now.
	
21.7.2000	Windowed preview <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: It's still unfinished (and sucks), but it mostly
	works now. I've added (copied from xawtv) clipping support. There
	are some bugs with it still.

20.7.2000	Modify channels <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c: Added the option to modify channels and a
	fine tuner
	* glade/zapping.glade: Modified accordingly.
	* src/main.c: Fixed ratio is working (although it doesn't work
	under Sawfish)
	* macros/autogen.sh: Little fix, it tried to autoconf mp1e's
	configure.in (it's in the same CVS tree as zapping)
	* src/callbacks.c: Added some (very rudimentary) support for
	windowed overlay mode. It just sucks, and will suck forever, but
	people ask for it :-/
	
19.7.2000	Option for keeping the ratio <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/properties.c: Added the option (doesn't do anything for now)
	to keep a given aspect ratio when resizing.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Updated the properties dialog accordingly.

04.7.2000	configure.in fix <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: configure.in now tries "-lpng -lz" if "-lpng"
	fails.
	* /me: I'm working with M.Schimek in a lib front-end for mp1e,
	don't expect changes in Zapping in the near future.

21.6.2000	Timestamps <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng: Timestamps support has been added
	* src/plugins: Now the plugins receive a sample object (a+v), not
	just video.

20.6.2000	Channel finder <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c: Added the option to find automagically all
	the tunable channels (works fine in V4L, a bit worse in V4L2)
	* src/tveng2.c: Fixed, so it can do channel searching.

19.6.2000	datadir fixed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Now the need to specify the datadir option has
	disappeared, --prefix is enough.
	* tveng1.c: Worked around a bug in the bttv driver, the returned
	maximum capture width isn't correct (thanks to Marcel Janssen)

14.6.2000	Right-click menu <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/callbacks.c: Fullscreen mode grabs the keyboard again, but
	it is apparently safe now.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Added a right click menu. Not very useful,
	but it is fancy and somewhat faster to use.
	* src/tveng.c: Now it fills the fb_info struct correctly on startup.

13.6.2000	Sound fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/sound.c: Some fixes have been made, now it should be
	somewhat faster. It is yet untested.
	* src/tveng.c: Added support for 15 bpp screen depth.
	* zapping.spec.in: Fixed, now it adds the translations to the RPM
	correctly.
	* src/callbacks.c: Fullscreen mode no longer grabs the
	keybord. This should avoid blocking X (completely :-) if something
	doesn't work while we are fullscreen.

12.6.2000	Docs added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* help/C/channel_editor.html: Added.
	* src/sound.c: Sound capturing support is now complete. It is
	slow, though.
	* src/tveng.c: Fixed a couple of memleaks in
	tveng_get_display_depth (memprof is great!)
	
09.6.2000	VidMode extension <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: If a better resolution for going fullscreen is
	available, switch to it using the Vidmode extension.
	
07.6.2000	fr.po added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fr.po: thanks to Christian Marillat a french translation is
	available.
	* main.c: Zapping now saves the current input and the current
	standard.
	* zapping.spec.in: I got to build a RPM, seems to work.
	
06.6.2000	Lazy day <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* help/C/properties.c: Added the help for the properties
	* zapping.spec.in: Written, but it doesn't build yet, and lacks
	dependencies.
	
04.6.2000	Plugin code remade <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/plugin_properties.c:
	* glade/zapping.glade: Dialog layout redesigned, now the plugins
	are configurable from the plugin_properties dialog too.
	* src/sound.[ch]: Preliminary esd sound support added.
	
02.6.2000	First problems fixed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Added the option to disable X extensions (DGA)
	from the configure script (thanks to Jan Castermans).
	* configure.in: Added a test to determine whether to use
	node->children or node->childs.
	* tveng: Added frame timestamps.
	* callbacks.c:
	* main.c: Added option for resizing with fixed increments.
	
01.6.2000	Bug fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* everything: Lots of bugs and fixme's have been corrected. Some
	code cleanups have been made too.
	* configure.in: Changed release number from 0.5.0pre1 to 0.5.0. I
	plan to release tomorrow.

29.5.2000	Tveng2 done <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng2.c:
	* tveng.c: The V4L2 driver has been [re]written and apparently it
	works fine. The bugs when opening external programs and changing
	inputs are still there, though :(
	* plugins.c: Converted plugin_get_priority into a more general
	pourpouse function, plugin_get_misc_info. Added cathegories too.

20.5.2000	Back into coding <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* /me: I'm very busy with my finals, i won't have much time for
	coding this month (and half of the next one) :(	
	* plugins.c:
	* plugin_common.h: New plugin structure, more flexible.
	* plugins/template/template.c:
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Adapted to the new API.
	* tveng: Started rewritting the V4L2 controller.

	doc.
	
24.4.2000	Again into CVS <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* CVS/: Zapping has gone again into CVS (it was time since the
	last cvs ci, but a lot of work has been done :)))
	* src/tveng1.c: All the V4L1 specific stuff has been placed here
	* src/tveng.c: Now it detects the video device driver (V4L1 or
	V4L2) and acts accordingly. Total rewrite.
	* help/C/plugin_devel.html: Created, it is the plugin API.
	
22.4.2000	Channel editor done <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* channel_editor.c: Finished, except for the help (not written)
	and autotuning (not written in tveng.c)
	* SF: Added the project to the Trove system in SourceForge.
	
21.4.2000	Channel editor improved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* channel_editor.c: Created. Holds the code for handling the
	channel editor dialog.

16.4.2000	properties done <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* callbacks.c: Properties dialog has been implemented, shows now
	some info about the video device (a la gnometv)
	* main.c: the video device name and zapping setup fb verbosity now
	can be configured, just as before
	* tveng.c: Added a range check in tveng_set_format, it prevents
	errors that let the device in a unusable state.
	
15.4.2000	help support added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* help/: The introduction to Zapping has been written here
	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in: Modified to reflect the above
	* callbacks.c: Some bugfixes
	* main.c: Everything works now, except for plugin support (the API
	has to be slightly modified)
	
15.4.2000	bugtrack day <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* v4linterface.c:
	* tveng.c:
	* callbacks.c: Lots of bugs were introduced, some have been fixed,
	now zapping works (almost) as 0.3.3 :-)
	* tveng.c:
	* v4linterface.c: Added language select control (mono, stereo,
	european1 and european2), but apparently it doesn't work.
	* tveng.c: Some conflictive and bttv-only code fragments have been
	#ifdef'ed.
	
14.4.2000	zapping reassembled <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* v4linterface.c: Adapted to the new tveng interface
	* everything: Zapping now is completely reassembled and compiles
	clean, lots of bugs have arosen, but i'm so happy ;-))))
	
13.4.2000	callbacks updated <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zapping.glade: Removed the 'Save screenshot button', it will be
	a plug-in.
	* callbacks.c: It now uses the new tveng api, it is much nicer to
	deal with, btw :-)
	* libglade: Posted a bug to the mantainer, the about box wouldn't
	show the logo properly, and that was a pity with such a nice
	Zapping logo.
	
13.4.2000	libglade in <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* interface.c: The project now uses libglade.
	* support.c: Removed from the project, it is now useless.
	
08.4.2000	zconf working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zconf.c: Now it is written and appears to work fine.
	
01.4.2000	New module <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zmisc.c: Created, is a place for putting some misc functions
	that didn't fit elsewhere.
	
01.4.2000	ZConf API created <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zconf.h: It holds the new zconf API, but nothing of it is
	implemented yet.
	
31.3.2000	Using shared mem <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c: The program uses shared mem for displaying the data,
	it is faster now.
	* tveng.c: Removed info->format.data, now a parameter must be
	supplied to tveng_read_frame, the user of tveng must take care now
	about allocating memory.
	
30.3.2000	V4L fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: Some bugs in tveng for V4L have been fixed, now should
	work quite reliably (tveng_[sg]et_format,
	tveng_start/stop_capturing, tveng_read_frame,
	p_tveng_[de]queue, ... had to be tested and fixed).
	* tveng.c: tveng_attach_device sets a correct starting capture
	size and tveng_set_capture_size stops capturing as neccesary.
	* everything: The new 0.5 series are into CVS again ;-)
	
27.3.2000	V4L support ended <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: V4L support has been completed after 9 days, i've been
	very busy this two weeks with the Uni :-(
	* main.c: Rewritten, it was becoming very messy.
	* zconf.c: Created. It's a config saving module, created with
	gconf porting in mind.
	* plugins.c: The new plugin protocol has been designed, it lacks
	the implementation yet, and some docs.
	
18.3.2000	V4L support started <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: It has been converted to V4L and the API has changed
	significantly. Now the rest of the program must be changed...
	* zapping_setup_fb: Converted to V4L
	* Release: 0.3.2 contained a bug in the distro, a bug fix release
	has been made, named 0.3.3.
	
24.2.2000	New release: 0.3.2 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c:
	* callbacks.c: Added a tveng_read_frame() function and fixed some
	bugs. This is the first version considered "working". The plugin
	protocol shouldn't change too much in the near future.
	* tveng.c: i cannot get read() calls to work under v4l2 yet :-(
	
22.2.2000	Plugin support finished <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c: The plugin support is now completely integrated into
	zapping, i made a test plugin and works fine.
	
20.2.2000	Plugin config saved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c: Now the plugins can save/restore their configuration
	
19.2.2000	Plugin structure ready <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugin.c: The plugin loading / unloading funtions work
	
19.2.2000	Added the project to CVS <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Generic: The project has been added to
	  cvs.zapping.sourceforge.net, it can now be accessed anonymously
	* zapping_setup_fb: Has moved from src/zapping_setup_fb to
	  zapping_setup_fb in order to follow the 'no / in Makefile.am'
	  rule, and not to break automake.
	* io.c: Minor changes
	
11.2.2000	Suid and preview operative <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: I finished the preview
	  code and the suid program, i hope it hasn't many security flaws.
	* src/interface.c: some more configurable properties
	* pixmaps/0.3-logo.png: Created a nice logo with the Gimp


2.2.2000 	Fullscreen mode working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* src/tveng.c: Fullscreen mode now works (although the code now is
	just a hack, needs to be cleaned up)
	* Makefile.am: Added the suid to the project, now it compiles
	
29.1.2000 	First _really_ working version <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng.c: Fairly complete V4L2 wrapping library
	* src/io.c: Ability to capture PNG images
	* src/tveng.c: Direct Video Blitting (BGR -> RGB conversion avoided)
	* src/interface.c: Channel editor added
