22.4.2000	Channel editor done <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* channel_editor.c: Finished, except for the help (not written)
	and autotuning (not written in tveng.c)
	* SF: Added the project to the Trove system in SourceForge.
	
21.4.2000	Channel editor improved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* channel_editor.c: Created. Holds the code for handling the
	channel editor dialog.
	* frequencies.c: Added tveng_get_id_of_channel and
	tveng_get_id_of_country_tune, needed by channel_editor.c
	* callbacks.h: Cleanup and some comments have been added
	* src/Makefile.am: Added channel_editor.c to the list of sources.

20.4.2000	misc improvements <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* properties.c: Created, holds all the code for handling the
	properties dialog.
	* zapping.glade: Channel choosing dialog redesigned.
	* tveng.c: Added a parameter to tveng_attach_device (attach_mode)
	* callbacks.c: Cleaned a hack used in go_windowed
	
16.4.2000	properties done <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* callbacks.c: Properties dialog has been implemented, shows now
	some info about the video device (a la gnometv)
	* main.c: the video device name and zapping setup fb verbosity now
	can be configured, just as before
	* tveng.c: Added a range check in tveng_set_format, it prevents
	errors that let the device in a unusable state.
	
15.4.2000	help support added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* help/: The introduction to Zapping has been written here
	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in: Modified to reflect the above
	* callbacks.c: Some bugfixes
	* main.c: Everything works now, except for plugin support (the API
	has to be slightly modified)
	
15.4.2000	bugtrack day <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* v4linterface.c:
	* tveng.c:
	* callbacks.c: Lots of bugs were introduced, some have been fixed,
	now zapping works (almost) as 0.3.3 :-)
	* tveng.c:
	* v4linterface.c: Added language select control (mono, stereo,
	european1 and european2), but apparently it doesn't work.
	* tveng.c: Some conflictive and bttv-only code fragments have been
	#ifdef'ed.
	
14.4.2000	zapping reassembled <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* v4linterface.c: Adapted to the new tveng interface
	* everything: Zapping now is completely reassembled and compiles
	clean, lots of bugs have arosen, but i'm so happy ;-))))
	
13.4.2000	callbacks updated <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zapping.glade: Removed the 'Save screenshot button', it will be
	a plug-in.
	* callbacks.c: It now uses the new tveng api, it is much nicer to
	deal with, btw :-)
	* libglade: Posted a bug to the mantainer, the about box wouldn't
	show the logo properly, and that was a pity with such a nice
	Zapping logo.
	
13.4.2000	libglade in <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* interface.c: The project now uses libglade.
	* support.c: Removed from the project, it is now useless.
	
08.4.2000	zconf working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zconf.c: Now it is written and appears to work fine.
	
01.4.2000	New module <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zmisc.c: Created, is a place for putting some misc functions
	that didn't fit elsewhere.
	
01.4.2000	ZConf API created <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zconf.h: It holds the new zconf API, but nothing of it is
	implemented yet.
	
31.3.2000	Using shared mem <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c: The program uses shared mem for displaying the data,
	it is faster now.
	* tveng.c: Removed info->format.data, now a parameter must be
	supplied to tveng_read_frame, the user of tveng must take care now
	about allocating memory.
	
30.3.2000	V4L fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: Some bugs in tveng for V4L have been fixed, now should
	work quite reliably (tveng_[sg]et_format,
	tveng_start/stop_capturing, tveng_read_frame,
	p_tveng_[de]queue, ... had to be tested and fixed).
	* tveng.c: tveng_attach_device sets a correct starting capture
	size and tveng_set_capture_size stops capturing as neccesary.
	* everything: The new 0.5 series are into CVS again ;-)
	
27.3.2000	V4L support ended <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: V4L support has been completed after 9 days, i've been
	very busy this two weeks with the Uni :-(
	* main.c: Rewritten, it was becoming very messy.
	* zconf.c: Created. It's a config saving module, created with
	gconf porting in mind.
	* plugins.c: The new plugin protocol has been designed, it lacks
	the implementation yet, and some docs.
	
18.3.2000	V4L support started <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: It has been converted to V4L and the API has changed
	significantly. Now the rest of the program must be changed...
	* zapping_setup_fb: Converted to V4L
	* Release: 0.3.2 contained a bug in the distro, a bug fix release
	has been made, named 0.3.3.
	
24.2.2000	New release: 0.3.2 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c:
	* callbacks.c: Added a tveng_read_frame() function and fixed some
	bugs. This is the first version considered "working". The plugin
	protocol shouldn't change too much in the near future.
	* tveng.c: i cannot get read() calls to work under v4l2 yet :-(
	
22.2.2000	Plugin support finished <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c: The plugin support is now completely integrated into
	zapping, i made a test plugin and works fine.
	
20.2.2000	Plugin config saved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c: Now the plugins can save/restore their configuration
	
19.2.2000	Plugin structure ready <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugin.c: The plugin loading / unloading funtions work
	
19.2.2000	Added the project to CVS <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Generic: The project has been added to
	  cvs.zapping.sourceforge.net, it can now be accessed anonymously
	* zapping_setup_fb: Has moved from src/zapping_setup_fb to
	  zapping_setup_fb in order to follow the 'no / in Makefile.am'
	  rule, and not to break automake.
	* io.c: Minor changes
	
11.2.2000	Suid and preview operative <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: I finished the preview
	  code and the suid program, i hope it hasn't many security flaws.
	* src/interface.c: some more configurable properties
	* pixmaps/0.3-logo.png: Created a nice logo with the Gimp


2.2.2000 	Fullscreen mode working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* src/tveng.c: Fullscreen mode now works (although the code now is
	just a hack, needs to be cleaned up)
	* Makefile.am: Added the suid to the project, now it compiles
	
29.1.2000 	First _really_ working version <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng.c: Fairly complete V4L2 wrapping library
	* src/io.c: Ability to capture PNG images
	* src/tveng.c: Direct Video Blitting (BGR -> RGB conversion avoided)
	* src/interface.c: Channel editor added
