01.3.2000	New module <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zmisc.c: Created, is a place for putting some misc functions
	that didn't fit elsewhere.
	
01.3.2000	ZConf API created <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zconf.h: It holds the new zconf API, but nothing of it is
	implemented yet.
	
31.3.2000	Using shared mem <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c: The program uses shared mem for displaying the data,
	it is faster now.
	* tveng.c: Removed info->format.data, now a parameter must be
	supplied to tveng_read_frame, the user of tveng must take care now
	about allocating memory.
	
30.3.2000	V4L fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: Some bugs in tveng for V4L have been fixed, now should
	work quite reliably (tveng_[sg]et_format,
	tveng_start/stop_capturing, tveng_read_frame,
	p_tveng_[de]queue, ... had to be tested and fixed).
	* tveng.c: tveng_attach_device sets a correct starting capture
	size and tveng_set_capture_size stops capturing as neccesary.
	* everything: The new 0.5 series are into CVS again ;-)
	
27.3.2000	V4L support ended <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: V4L support has been completed after 9 days, i've been
	very busy this two weeks with the Uni :-(
	* main.c: Rewritten, it was becoming very messy.
	* zconf.c: Created. It's a config saving module, created with
	gconf porting in mind.
	* plugins.c: The new plugin protocol has been designed, it lacks
	the implementation yet, and some docs.
	
18.3.2000	V4L support started <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: It has been converted to V4L and the API has changed
	significantly. Now the rest of the program must be changed...
	* zapping_setup_fb: Converted to V4L
	* Release: 0.3.2 contained a bug in the distro, a bug fix release
	has been made, named 0.3.3.
	
24.2.2000	New release: 0.3.2 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c:
	* callbacks.c: Added a tveng_read_frame() function and fixed some
	bugs. This is the first version considered "working". The plugin
	protocol shouldn't change too much in the near future.
	* tveng.c: i cannot get read() calls to work under v4l2 yet :-(
	
22.2.2000	Plugin support finished <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c: The plugin support is now completely integrated into
	zapping, i made a test plugin and works fine.
	
20.2.2000	Plugin config saved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c: Now the plugins can save/restore their configuration
	
19.2.2000	Plugin structure ready <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugin.c: The plugin loading / unloading funtions work
	
19.2.2000	Added the project to CVS <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Generic: The project has been added to
	  cvs.zapping.sourceforge.net, it can now be accessed anonymously
	* zapping_setup_fb: Has moved from src/zapping_setup_fb to
	  zapping_setup_fb in order to follow the 'no / in Makefile.am'
	  rule, and not to break automake.
	* io.c: Minor changes
	
11.2.2000	Suid and preview operative <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: I finished the preview
	  code and the suid program, i hope it hasn't many security flaws.
	* src/interface.c: some more configurable properties
	* pixmaps/0.3-logo.png: Created a nice logo with the Gimp


2.2.2000 	Fullscreen mode working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* src/tveng.c: Fullscreen mode now works (although the code now is
	just a hack, needs to be cleaned up)
	* Makefile.am: Added the suid to the project, now it compiles
	
29.1.2000 	First _really_ working version <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng.c: Fairly complete V4L2 wrapping library
	* src/io.c: Ability to capture PNG images
	* src/tveng.c: Direct Video Blitting (BGR -> RGB conversion avoided)
	* src/interface.c: Channel editor added
