11.2.2000	Suid created and preview code fully operative
--------
	+ I finished the preview code and the suid program, i hope it
	  hasn't many security flaws
	+ Development has been stalled these days, in the next days i plan
	  to add support for plugins (libraries), so avi, png, ... saving
	  will move outside the program, and the program can be used to do
	  image processing (just adding a new plugin). I have to figure
	  out how to do this plugin stuff, though.
	+ Added some more configurable properties
	+ Created a nice logo with the Gimp


2.2.2000 	Fullscreen mode working
--------
	+ I finally got this Overlay code working! Fullscreen mode
	  works (although the code just now is nothing but a HACK[tm])
	+ Some bug fixes to the previous version.
	+ Passed my first Uni exam (OK, it hasn't got anything to do
	  with Zapping, but it's a change for me ;-)
	
29.1.2000 	0.3 working (although I have no Web site to put it)

	+ Working Video Capture (mmap'ed) engine
	+ Ability to capture PNG images
	+ Direct Video Blitting (BGR -> RGB conversion avoided)
	+ Configuration saved as XML
