	* plugins/screenshot: Added this needed converter.

04.11.2000	MPEG starts to work <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/mpeg: It starts to work fine after many bugfixes in rte.
	* src/tveng2.c: Fixed a bug that made it segfault when changing
	standards. Well, not really a bug, but a "feature" of the bttv2
	driver.
	* src/tveng: Use seconds as the timestamp unit, it's a double now.

31.10.2000	More work on Xv <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/capture.c: Default Xv pixformat is YUYV now, was UYVY.
	* src/tveng1.c: Fixed the YUV modes defs (TVENG_PIX_YUV420 =
	PALETTE_YUV420P, not PALETTE_YUV420)

30.10.2000	Capture code working <garetxe@eusers.sourceforge.net>

	* src/capture.c: It can work without Xv support now.

	YUYV).
	* src/main.c:
	* src/zmisc.c: The capture code now goes into capture.c

	extension is present and it works).

28.10.2000	ZVBI more modular <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zvbi.c, zvbi.h: Now the callbacks that handle the VBI are
	self-contained, they don't need to be called from other modules.
	* src/tveng2.c, src/videodev2.h: Brought up-to-date with the
	latest videodevX.
	* src/capture.c: Some preliminar Xv code has been written.

	* src/tveng.c: Now the debug level can be changed using
	tveng_set_debug_level.
	* src/sound: Removed sound support. It wasn't used, and it was
	causing some problems.

	* plugins/mpeg: rte is now ready, i'm starting the wrapper plugin.
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Modified as necessary

14.10.2000	XGetScreenSaver <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/x11stuff.c: Use XGetScreenSaver and friends to modify the
	screensaver, but it doesn't appear to work yet :-(

	aceleration supported.
	* src/mmx.h:
	* src/mmx.c: MMX detecting and handling helper functions.
	* src/overlay.{ch}: Overlay handling code, completely
	rewritten. Now it works perfectly, just a bit of necessary
	flicker.
	* src/x11stuff.{ch}: Low-level X11 stuff. I'll try to stick with
	GDK in the rest of Zapping for the sake of clarity.
	* src/tveng2.c: Some fixes to make it work with the newest bttv2
	and videodevX.

23.9.2000	back again <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

17.9.2000	fr.po updated <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/fr.po: Updated (Christian Marillat)

16.9.2000	/dev/dsp bug closed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/main.c: When VBI was disabled, the previous capture mode was
	set automatically to CAPTURE, fixed.
	* src/tveng.c: tveng_attach_device prints info about the video
	device on success (if not configured with --disable-tveng-debug)
	* src/tveng.c: Kernel 2.4.0test8's bttv makes the program hang if
	the given width and height aren't valid, fixed (was '/dev/dsp bug')
	* src/tveng.c: Added the option to tveng_device_info_new to use a
	standard norm is the input we are going to switch to is tunerless
	(so it defaults to PAL).
	* src/main.c: Added the command line option to control the default
	norm (--tunerless-norm, -n)

14.9.2000	Kernel 2.4.0test8 <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* /box: Installed the new kernel, a number of problems have arisen
	with Zapping. I can reproduce now the /dev/dsp bug! I don't have a
	clue of the cause, though :-)
	* /box: NOTE: Some user related that the problem disappeared after
	installing Gerd's bttv over the 2.4.0test8's one. Check.
	* src/sound.c: bugfix, even when esd failed to open the device,
	startup_sound returned succeeded.
	* src/main.c: Sound can be disabled by a command line  option and
	if startup_sound fails.
	* README: Updated, added a quick troubleshooting.

13.9.2000	Teletext processed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zvbi.c, src/main.c: The teletext image is now received by
	the plugins, so it can be processed.
	* src/plugins.c: The plugin_sample struct no longer contains a
	GdkImage.
	* plugins/screenshot: Now it saves the current teletext page too.
	* src/strnatcmp: Like strcmp and strcasecmp, but perform natural
	ordering of strings with numbers (1, 2, 3, .., 8, 9, 10, 11)
	* src/strnatcmp.c: fall back to str[case]cmp if they compare the
	same in natural order.
	* src/frequencies.c: Now it uses strnatcmp for station aliases.
	
12.9.2000	JPEG screenshots <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/screenshot.c: Now it uses JPEG format instead of PNG.
	* main.c: Added option to disable VBI on startup (avoid V4L2
	crashes)
	* src/zvbi.c: Added debug messages

11.9.2000	New release <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* html docs: Updated.
	* src/tveng.c: Support for command-line bpp added.
	* src/callbacks.c: The screensaver now goes to throttle mode when
	Fullscreen is used.

08.9.2000	History improved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: txtcontrols redesigned, now it only shows
	the visited pages, not page + subpage. For using both, a tree
	would be better.
	* src/zvbi.c: Added a web-browser-like history, and a visited
	pages list. It's easier to navigate now. Added fast navigation
	("color" navigation, FLOF), and subpage/page recognision.
	* src/main.c: Added command line option --bpp.

07.9.2000	History implemented <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/txtcontrols.c: Previous, next work for pages and subpages,
	history is saved when setting pages.

06.9.2000	VBI integrated <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* glade/zapping.glade: VBI has been integrated into the GUI.
	* src/callbacks.c: Added code for switching to VBI
	* src/zvbi.c: Much less CPU usage (pre-rendered frames, draw only
	when neccessary)
	* pixmaps/vt_loading*: Two images (~11K) created for when the
	requested page isn't available.
	* src/channel_editor.c: Uses VBI for getting the station names.
	* src/main.c: Added config setting for saving the VBI state.
	* src/txtcontrols.c: Created, manages the VBI GUI.

05.9.2000	Bpp fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zapping_setup_fb: Now accepts command line --bpp option
	* src/zvbi.c: Does most of the work. Fetches, renders and scales
	automagically teletext pages. Depends on GdkPixbuf to work.
	* src/properties.c: Now the VBI properties are modificable.

04.9.2000	Bug fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng[12].c: Fixes in the fullscreen mode, it had errors
	related to non-functional DGA drivers. Now most of the
	functionality goes into the VidMode extension, that usually works.

03.9.2000	Project structure changes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: It's a bit cleaner now, and commited to CVS
	* src/zvbi.c: Gets the date and the name on each header/xpacket
	* configure.in: Not having -lpng is not longer fatal, conditional
	plugin build, [optional] GdkPixbuf support added (i will need it
	for the VBI plugin)

01.9.2000	VBI support added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvbi/: Added support for VBI (stolen from alevt)
	* src/zvbi.c: Swallow support and encapsulation added

25.8.2000	mode switch when needed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/screenshot: Now switchs to capture mode automagically
	when overlay. Doesn't switch back, though.
	* src/zmisc.c: ShowBox now accepts parameters (like sprintf,
	printf and friends)

24.8.2000	back to work <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/fr.po: Updated the french translation (Christian Marillat)
	* src/callbacks.c: The focus change no longer makes the overlay
	refresh (was a bit visually unpleasant)
	* src/tveng[12].c: Added a configure option to avoid initial
	channel and standard selection.

27.7.2000	mode switching <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Added a routine for switching modes correctly.
	
23.7.2000	Misc bug fixing <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Fixed the segfault when quitting (i believe so, at
	least).
	* src/tveng.c: Fixed some memleaks with the X code, and made it
	restore the VidMode correctly when returning from fullscreen.
	* src/zconf.c: Fixed the problems with the help being opened by
	Mozilla - it was a mem-leak, g_get_home_dir returns a static
	string, and I was g_free'ing it.
	* plugins/screenshot: It now checks for capture mode before starting.
	* help/C: I updated the docs and the screenshots.
	
22.7.2000	Windowed preview working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: Fixed the last bugs with it except one, that i
	would need to get events from the root window to fix (and I don't
	want to). You could call it a "feature" ;-) Did I tell that
	windowed preview sucks? There is a bug with it that i'm trying to
	reproduce (a SIGSEGV when exitting)
	* src/tveng2.c: Fixed a bug with clipping rectangles. The struct
	wasn't built correctly for more than one rectangle.
	* everything: The windowed mode has been integrated in the program
	(TVENG_CAPTURE_WINDOW mode).
	* src/zmisc.c: I think the SIGSEGV previously mencioned is fixed now.
	
21.7.2000	Windowed preview <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zmisc.c: It's still unfinished (and sucks), but it mostly
	works now. I've added (copied from xawtv) clipping support. There
	are some bugs with it still.

20.7.2000	Modify channels <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c: Added the option to modify channels and a
	fine tuner
	* glade/zapping.glade: Modified accordingly.
	* src/main.c: Fixed ratio is working (although it doesn't work
	under Sawfish)
	* macros/autogen.sh: Little fix, it tried to autoconf mp1e's
	configure.in (it's in the same CVS tree as zapping)
	* src/callbacks.c: Added some (very rudimentary) support for
	windowed overlay mode. It just sucks, and will suck forever, but
	people ask for it :-/
	
19.7.2000	Option for keeping the ratio <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/properties.c: Added the option (doesn't do anything for now)
	to keep a given aspect ratio when resizing.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Updated the properties dialog accordingly.

04.7.2000	configure.in fix <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: configure.in now tries "-lpng -lz" if "-lpng"
	fails.
	* /me: I'm working with M.Schimek in a lib front-end for mp1e,
	don't expect changes in Zapping in the near future.

21.6.2000	Timestamps <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng: Timestamps support has been added
	* src/plugins: Now the plugins receive a sample object (a+v), not
	just video.

20.6.2000	Channel finder <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/channel_editor.c: Added the option to find automagically all
	the tunable channels (works fine in V4L, a bit worse in V4L2)
	* src/tveng2.c: Fixed, so it can do channel searching.

19.6.2000	datadir fixed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Now the need to specify the datadir option has
	disappeared, --prefix is enough.
	* tveng1.c: Worked around a bug in the bttv driver, the returned
	maximum capture width isn't correct (thanks to Marcel Janssen)

14.6.2000	Right-click menu <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/callbacks.c: Fullscreen mode grabs the keyboard again, but
	it is apparently safe now.
	* glade/zapping.glade: Added a right click menu. Not very useful,
	but it is fancy and somewhat faster to use.
	* src/tveng.c: Now it fills the fb_info struct correctly on startup.

13.6.2000	Sound fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/sound.c: Some fixes have been made, now it should be
	somewhat faster. It is yet untested.
	* src/tveng.c: Added support for 15 bpp screen depth.
	* zapping.spec.in: Fixed, now it adds the translations to the RPM
	correctly.
	* src/callbacks.c: Fullscreen mode no longer grabs the
	keybord. This should avoid blocking X (completely :-) if something
	doesn't work while we are fullscreen.

12.6.2000	Docs added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* help/C/channel_editor.html: Added.
	* src/sound.c: Sound capturing support is now complete. It is
	slow, though.
	* src/tveng.c: Fixed a couple of memleaks in
	tveng_get_display_depth (memprof is great!)
	
09.6.2000	VidMode extension <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: If a better resolution for going fullscreen is
	available, switch to it using the Vidmode extension.
	
07.6.2000	fr.po added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fr.po: thanks to Christian Marillat a french translation is
	available.
	* main.c: Zapping now saves the current input and the current
	standard.
	* zapping.spec.in: I got to build a RPM, seems to work.
	
06.6.2000	Lazy day <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* help/C/properties.c: Added the help for the properties
	* zapping.spec.in: Written, but it doesn't build yet, and lacks
	dependencies.
	
04.6.2000	Plugin code remade <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/plugin_properties.c:
	* glade/zapping.glade: Dialog layout redesigned, now the plugins
	are configurable from the plugin_properties dialog too.
	* src/sound.[ch]: Preliminary esd sound support added.
	
02.6.2000	First problems fixed <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Added the option to disable X extensions (DGA)
	from the configure script (thanks to Jan Castermans).

	node->children or node->childs.
	* tveng: Added frame timestamps.
	* callbacks.c:
	* main.c: Added option for resizing with fixed increments.
	
01.6.2000	Bug fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* everything: Lots of bugs and fixme's have been corrected. Some
	code cleanups have been made too.
	* configure.in: Changed release number from 0.5.0pre1 to 0.5.0. I
	plan to release tomorrow.

29.5.2000	Tveng2 done <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng2.c:
	* tveng.c: The V4L2 driver has been [re]written and apparently it
	works fine. The bugs when opening external programs and changing
	inputs are still there, though :(
	* plugins.c: Converted plugin_get_priority into a more general
	pourpouse function, plugin_get_misc_info. Added cathegories too.

20.5.2000	Back into coding <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* /me: I'm very busy with my finals, i won't have much time for
	coding this month (and half of the next one) :(	
	* plugins.c:
	* plugin_common.h: New plugin structure, more flexible.
	* plugins/template/template.c:
	* plugins/screenshot/screenshot.c: Adapted to the new API.
	* tveng: Started rewritting the V4L2 controller.
	* zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setub_fb.c: Corrected verbosity and

	doc.
	
24.4.2000	Again into CVS <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* CVS/: Zapping has gone again into CVS (it was time since the
	last cvs ci, but a lot of work has been done :)))
	* src/tveng1.c: All the V4L1 specific stuff has been placed here
	* src/tveng.c: Now it detects the video device driver (V4L1 or
	V4L2) and acts accordingly. Total rewrite.
	* help/C/plugin_devel.html: Created, it is the plugin API.
	
22.4.2000	Channel editor done <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* channel_editor.c: Finished, except for the help (not written)
	and autotuning (not written in tveng.c)
	* SF: Added the project to the Trove system in SourceForge.
	
21.4.2000	Channel editor improved <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* callbacks.c: Properties dialog has been implemented, shows now
	some info about the video device (a la gnometv)
	* main.c: the video device name and zapping setup fb verbosity now
	can be configured, just as before
	* tveng.c: Added a range check in tveng_set_format, it prevents
	errors that let the device in a unusable state.
	
15.4.2000	help support added <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* help/: The introduction to Zapping has been written here
	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in: Modified to reflect the above
	* callbacks.c: Some bugfixes
	* main.c: Everything works now, except for plugin support (the API
	has to be slightly modified)
	
15.4.2000	bugtrack day <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* v4linterface.c:
	* tveng.c:
	* callbacks.c: Lots of bugs were introduced, some have been fixed,
	now zapping works (almost) as 0.3.3 :-)
	* tveng.c:
	* v4linterface.c: Added language select control (mono, stereo,
	european1 and european2), but apparently it doesn't work.
	* tveng.c: Some conflictive and bttv-only code fragments have been
	#ifdef'ed.
	
14.4.2000	zapping reassembled <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* v4linterface.c: Adapted to the new tveng interface
	* everything: Zapping now is completely reassembled and compiles
	clean, lots of bugs have arosen, but i'm so happy ;-))))
	
13.4.2000	callbacks updated <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zapping.glade: Removed the 'Save screenshot button', it will be
	a plug-in.
	* callbacks.c: It now uses the new tveng api, it is much nicer to
	deal with, btw :-)
	* libglade: Posted a bug to the mantainer, the about box wouldn't
	show the logo properly, and that was a pity with such a nice
	Zapping logo.
	
13.4.2000	libglade in <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* interface.c: The project now uses libglade.
	* support.c: Removed from the project, it is now useless.
	
08.4.2000	zconf working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* zconf.c: Now it is written and appears to work fine.
	
01.4.2000	New module <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	that didn't fit elsewhere.
	
01.4.2000	ZConf API created <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	implemented yet.
	
31.3.2000	Using shared mem <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c: The program uses shared mem for displaying the data,
	it is faster now.
	* tveng.c: Removed info->format.data, now a parameter must be
	supplied to tveng_read_frame, the user of tveng must take care now
	about allocating memory.
	
30.3.2000	V4L fixes <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: Some bugs in tveng for V4L have been fixed, now should
	work quite reliably (tveng_[sg]et_format,
	tveng_start/stop_capturing, tveng_read_frame,
	p_tveng_[de]queue, ... had to be tested and fixed).
	* tveng.c: tveng_attach_device sets a correct starting capture
	size and tveng_set_capture_size stops capturing as neccesary.
	* everything: The new 0.5 series are into CVS again ;-)
	
27.3.2000	V4L support ended <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: V4L support has been completed after 9 days, i've been
	very busy this two weeks with the Uni :-(
	* main.c: Rewritten, it was becoming very messy.
	* zconf.c: Created. It's a config saving module, created with
	gconf porting in mind.
	* plugins.c: The new plugin protocol has been designed, it lacks
	the implementation yet, and some docs.
	
18.3.2000	V4L support started <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tveng.c: It has been converted to V4L and the API has changed
	significantly. Now the rest of the program must be changed...
	* zapping_setup_fb: Converted to V4L

	* plugins.c:
	* main.c:
	* callbacks.c: Added a tveng_read_frame() function and fixed some

	  cvs.zapping.sourceforge.net, it can now be accessed anonymously
	* zapping_setup_fb: Has moved from src/zapping_setup_fb to
	  zapping_setup_fb in order to follow the 'no / in Makefile.am'
	  rule, and not to break automake.
	* io.c: Minor changes
	
11.2.2000	Suid and preview operative <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/zapping_setup_fb/zapping_setup_fb.c: I finished the preview
	  code and the suid program, i hope it hasn't many security flaws.

2.2.2000 	Fullscreen mode working <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the suid to the project, now it compiles
	
29.1.2000 	First _really_ working version <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tveng.c: Fairly complete V4L2 wrapping library
