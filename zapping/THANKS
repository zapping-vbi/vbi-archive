Thanks to Christian Marillat for the french translation.
Thanks to Michael Schimek for helping me with the mp1e
code, and for building such a wonderful program.
Thanks to Edgar Toerning for the AleVT code, in which libvbi (the
teletext decoder built into Zapping) is based, and for his permission
to use it.

And, of course, thanks to the people that sent bug reports and suggestions.
