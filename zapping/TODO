Outstanding issues for future releases
--------------------------------------

* Keyboard preferences: Python commands should not be visible,
  by default. Use GtkAction?
* Recording: like mixer volume, substitute tv card brightness and
  contrast control when available for XVPutImage.
* Examine interaction of Zapping (esp. overlay) with RANDR.
  http://keithp.com/~keithp/talks/randr/randr/
  xc/doc/specs/Randr, xrandr et al
* Examine possibility of fullscreen window at the
  root window layer.
* Support libzvbi proxyd
* Most of the Zapzilla code belongs in a plugin.
* After "add all channels" in the channel editor Zapping
  should scan for station names.
* UYVY in mpeg plugin.
* Channel up/down should finish channel number entering
  on keypad or (a)lirc.
* Prefs building takes longer and longer, it's annoying.
* Maybe Zapping should support all xawtv command line options?
* We need an Xv overlay port menu.
* http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/porting/ checklist.
* Are we using window fully visible, partially visible and
  fully obscured X11 events to optimize capture mode?
  See overlay.c.
* preferences from context menu (zapping-misc 2003-01-05)
* configure.in: esd, oss etc checks
* Video standard question.
* Improve documentation.
* Check compilation works without optional libs
* Switching subtitles on/off needs improvement.
* Fullscreen integrates badly into desktop, eg. context menu.
* vbi: add toggle button to disable CC/TTX decoding
  (independent of station name decoding, that is). Mind
  listing subtitles. Should also disable trigger
  decoding when all set to ignore.
* zapzilla: channel selector, properties.
* Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
* Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
* PIP?
* Take TTX out of the context menus when Zapping doesn't
  receive TTX. (event timestamps?)
* Better audio mode (mono/stereo etc) support.
* Check tveng has frame rate for timestamping. (Unlike mpeg bug.)
* Remove default overlay page?
* ttxview.c/selection_handle: What's the correct char set?
* Is zvbi really needed for osd?
* --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)
* Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
  http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
* More compression formats.
* Trigger: Close should remember it had been clicked already
  when a trigger is merely repeated.
* Recording schedule.
* Screenshot plugin: subtitle overlay
* Mpeg plugin/mp1e very low frame rate interrupts display,
  probably a scheduling issue. Investigate if/how this can be avoided.
* Examine the possiblity of linking movie titles, VBI plugin API.
* Deinterlace plugin.
* VBI station name ignored when card w/tuner & composite selected 
* Compress config file (libxml).
* Config toolbar using Iñaki's dnd code.
* Clean up context menu.
* Re-add toolbar style option.
* Remove tveng_frame_format.bytesperline.
* Verify all Gnome etc URLs everywhere.
* Proper error messages on xawtv import.

* Better 16:9 support:

  WSS acquisition needs to be more robust. Usually video and VBI
  capturing cannot overlap and video capturing includes the WSS
  line. Hardware (sliced) VBI decoding would pick it up despite video
  capturing, but not every hardware has the capability and AFAIK no
  driver supports the API yet. We can still sample the signal off
  captured images or even overlaid images by reading from video ram.

  To get rid of the annoying WSS and CG patterns in the picture, in
  overlay mode V4L2 cropping could reduce the image height, then the
  driver could shift the VBI capture window down to cover the WSS. If
  that's not possible one could still clip the line out, but then
  Zapping won't see WSS changes either. In capture mode reducing the
  height may conflict with recording (height mod 16 et al). Blanking
  the line after extracting WSS should be no problem.

  The appearance menu is editable now, nevertheless it must be
  possible to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 regardless of the current
  window size. I'd also like two 16:9 modes, one properly scaling
  anamorphic 16:9 and another to get rid of letterbox bars. Would be
  useful for proud owners of 16:9 monitors and generally save screen
  space.

  Overlay is usually limited to 768. Xv could overlay with bounce
  buffers in video ram, but right now doesn't. Zapping should
  automagically fall back to capture mode to achieve 1024x576. As a
  last resort it can scale to 768x432. Better yet it had a deinterlace
  plugin which can optionally scale 1024:768. We could use capture
  mode with field motion (50/60 Hz refresh rate) and compensate for
  filterless hw scaling. Just duplicating every third pixel already
  gives artefacts, not to mention dropping one of four field lines.

  Fullscreen mode currently implies overlay and the picture aspect is
  assumed 4:3. Actually the app should look up an XF86 Modeline with
  16:9 aspect or use e.g. 1024x768, kind of a HDTV letterbox.

* Maybe an external frequency table table would be nice. Would be
  easier to update, even remotely (libxml2 nanohttp). Possible
  file format:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE frequency_tables [
    <!ELEMENT frequency_tables (table+)>
    <!ELEMENT table (name,domain?,country+,videostandard+,range+)>
    <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)> <!-- (0-9|a-z|A-Z|_)+ -->

    <!ELEMENT bandwidth (#PCDATA)> <!-- Hz -->
    <!ATTLIST domain xml:lang NMTOKEN "en">

   <table>

    <videostandard>NTSC_M</videostandard>

    </range>
    &ccir_uhf;
   </table>
  </frequency_tables>
