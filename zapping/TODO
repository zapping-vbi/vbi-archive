Outstanding issues for the next release (0.6.0)
-----------------------------------------------
	+ Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ Find/draw some icons for the parrot buffer plugin.
	+ Reorganize toolbar, etc.

> 0.6.1
	+ extend OSD to allow arbitrary strings, not just CC and ttx.
	+ Add some remote control applet (or sth like that).
	+ Have a copy of the stuff in the "quick bar" in the main menu
	(for keyb navigation)
	+ Key combos for lazy guys like me (channels + mute)
	+ Fullscreen channel tips.
	+ GUI improvements (channel selection, controls, toolbar...),
	channel submenus.
	+ Revamp GUI for closed caption, program info, etc.
	+ Screenshot preview.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)
	+ Save control values and restore on startup (per channel).
	+ Save screenshots at arbitrary sizes.
	+ In ttx search progress window emphasis jumps between
	  Cancel and Prev, should be Cancel and Next. Is Cancel correct
	  at the left? And it may be cleaner with an Abort (the search)
	  and a Cancel (the dialog).
	+ In tty gui: The "R" (Reveal) button is unsuitable for i18n,
	  should be "?" (preferably a nice pixmap), and "?" as kbd
	  shortcut. Verify no other unNLSed accels exist.
	+ Improve documentation.
	+ Make controls move faster with the keyb, and avoid rounding
	issues (maxvalue never reached because of integer rounding)
	+ TTX export: Make blockgfx replacement smarter.
	+ Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
	  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). Needs some sort of
	  raw dump, so users can send updates. Upd: Oops, we do have a raw
	  dump: VTX.
	+ zapzilla: channel selector, properties.
	+ libvbi: SGML error reporting.

> Somewhen...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
	http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
	? Add a link to http://www.firstlinux.com/articles/zapping.shtml
	  on the Z homepage. There was another french review, URL?

please tell me about anything you think it's worth adding.
