Outstanding issues for the next release (0.6.2)
-----------------------------------------------
> 0.6.3
	+ Improve documentation.
	+ TTX export: Make blockgfx replacement smarter.
	+ vbi: add toggle button to disable CC/TTX decoding
          (independent of station name decoding, that is). Mind
	  listing subtitles. Should also disable trigger
          decoding when all set to ignore.
	+ rte: We need a TODO/Changelog for this, do not forget
	+ Look into scripting.
	+ Examine the possiblity of linking movie titles, VBI plugin API.
	+ Streaming ASCII plugin.
	+ zapzilla: channel selector, properties.
	+ Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ libvbi: SGML error reporting.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
	  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). Needs some sort of
	  raw dump, so users can send updates. Upd: Oops, we do have a raw
	  dump: VTX.
	+ Take TTX out of the context menus when Zapping doesn't
	  receive TTX. (event timestamps?)
	+ TTX program name
	+ Volume bindings
	+ Make Zapping UTF-8 clean (for now by moving all string ops
          into one place, propose zmisc.c, avoiding strlen etc).
	+ Finish WSS.

> 0.7.0
	+ Support for Python scripting, write all new gui handling as
	Python code.
	+ Add some remote control applet, or sth like that (moved here
	because it will use scripting).
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)

> Somewhen...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
	http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
	+ More compression formats.
	+ Trigger: Close should remember it had been clicked already
	  when a trigger is merely repeated.
	+ Recording schedule.
	+ Screenshot plugin: subtitle overlay
	+ TTX export ANSI colors needs improvement.
	+ Mpeg plugin/mp1e very low frame rate interrupts display,
	  probably a scheduling issue. Investigate if/how this can be avoided.

please tell me about anything you think it's worth adding.
