Outstanding issues for the next release (0.6.3)
-----------------------------------------------
> 0.6.3
	! Video standard question.
	+ Improve documentation.
	+ vbi: add toggle button to disable CC/TTX decoding
          (independent of station name decoding, that is). Mind
	  listing subtitles. Should also disable trigger
          decoding when all set to ignore.
	+ Examine the possiblity of linking movie titles, VBI plugin API.
	+ zapzilla: channel selector, properties.
	+ Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ Take TTX out of the context menus when Zapping doesn't
	  receive TTX. (event timestamps?)
	+ Volume bindings
	+ Make Zapping UTF-8 clean (for now by moving all string ops
          into one place, propose zmisc.c, avoiding strlen etc).
	+ Finish WSS.
	+ Check tveng has frame rate for timestamping. (Unlike mpeg bug.)
	+ Remove default overlay page?
	+ ttxview.c/selection_handle: What's the correct char set?
	+ Improve kbd shortcuts:

	+ Settings: Toolbar >> hide/show, icons, text, both
	+ Is zvbi really needed for osd?
	+ PIP?

> 0.7.0
	+ Support for Python scripting, write all new gui handling as
	Python code.
	+ Add some remote control applet, or sth like that (moved here
	because it will use scripting).
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)

> Somewhen...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
	http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
	+ More compression formats.
	+ Trigger: Close should remember it had been clicked already
	  when a trigger is merely repeated.
	+ Recording schedule.
	+ Screenshot plugin: subtitle overlay
	+ Mpeg plugin/mp1e very low frame rate interrupts display,
	  probably a scheduling issue. Investigate if/how this can be avoided.

please tell me about anything you think it's worth adding.
