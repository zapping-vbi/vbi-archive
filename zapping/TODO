Outstanding issues for the next release (0.6.2)
-----------------------------------------------
> 0.6.3
	+ Improve documentation.
	+ TTX export: Make blockgfx replacement smarter.
	+ vbi: add toggle button to disable CC/TTX decoding
          (independent of station name decoding, that is). Mind
	  listing subtitles. Should also disable trigger
          decoding when all set to ignore.
	+ Standards for each input.
	+ rte: We need a TODO/Changelog for this, do not forget
	+ rte: Add non-blocking push.
	+ Move tigrux's patch to a more convenient place.
	+ Look into scripting.
	+ Examine the possiblity of linking movie titles, VBI plugin API.
	+ Streaming ASCII plugin.
	+ zapzilla: channel selector, properties.
	+ Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ libvbi: SGML error reporting.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
	  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). Needs some sort of
	  raw dump, so users can send updates. Upd: Oops, we do have a raw
	  dump: VTX.
	+ Take TTX out of the context menus when Zapping doesn't
	  receive TTX. (event timestamps?)
	+ After hitting trigger close button, repetition of same message
	  should be suppressed, maybe with a short history.
	+ TTX program name
	+ Volume bindings

> 0.7.0
	+ Support for Python scripting, write all new gui handling as
	Python code.
	+ Add some remote control applet, or sth like that (moved here
	because it will use scripting).
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)

> Somewhen...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
	http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
	+ More compression formats.
	+ Trigger: Close should remember it had been clicked already
	  when a trigger is merely repeated.
	+ Recording schedule.

please tell me about anything you think it's worth adding.
