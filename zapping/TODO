Outstanding issues for the next release (0.6.2)
-----------------------------------------------
> 0.6.2
	+ Save control values and restore on startup (per channel).
	+ In ttx search, is Cancel correct at the left? And it may be
	  cleaner with an Abort (the search) and a Cancel (the dialog).
	+ Verify no unNLSed accels exist. (suitable replacement for H?)
	+ Improve documentation.
	+ Make controls move faster with the keyb, and avoid rounding
	  issues (maxvalue never reached because of integer rounding)
	+ TTX export: Make blockgfx replacement smarter. Streaming ascii
	  subtitles. HTML: replace nonstd <blink> by "text-decoration: blink;"

> 0.6.3
	+ Examine the possiblity of linking movie titles, VBI plugin API.
	+ zapzilla: channel selector, properties.
	+ Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ libvbi: SGML error reporting.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
	  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). Needs some sort of
	  raw dump, so users can send updates. Upd: Oops, we do have a raw
	  dump: VTX.

> 0.7.0
	+ Support for Python scripting, write all new gui handling as
	Python code.
	+ Add some remote control applet, or sth like that (moved here
	because it will use scripting).
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)

> Somewhen...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
	http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
	? Add a link to http://www.firstlinux.com/articles/zapping.shtml
	  on the Z homepage. There was another french review, URL?

please tell me about anything you think it's worth adding.
