Outstanding issues for the next release (0.6.2)
-----------------------------------------------
> 0.6.2
	+ Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ extend OSD to allow arbitrary strings, not just CC and ttx.
	+ Fullscreen channel tips.
	+ GUI improvements (channel selection, controls, toolbar...)
	+ Revamp GUI for closed caption, program info, etc.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)
	+ Save control values and restore on startup (per channel).
	+ In ttx search progress window emphasis jumps between
	  Cancel and Prev, should be Cancel and Next. Is Cancel correct
	  at the left? And it may be cleaner with an Abort (the search)
	  and a Cancel (the dialog).
	+ Verify no unNLSed accels exist. (suitable replacement for H?)
	+ Improve documentation.
	+ Make controls move faster with the keyb, and avoid rounding
	issues (maxvalue never reached because of integer rounding)
	+ TTX export: Make blockgfx replacement smarter. Streaming ascii
	  subtitles. HTML: replace nonstd <blink> by "text-decoration: blink;"
	+ Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
	  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). Needs some sort of
	  raw dump, so users can send updates. Upd: Oops, we do have a raw
	  dump: VTX.
	+ zapzilla: channel selector, properties.
	+ libvbi: SGML error reporting.
	+ Examine the possiblity of linking movie titles, VBI plugin API.

> 0.7.0
	+ Support for Python scripting, write all new gui handling as
	Python code.
	+ Add some remote control applet, or sth like that (moved here
	because it will use scripting).

> Somewhen...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
	http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
	? Add a link to http://www.firstlinux.com/articles/zapping.shtml
	  on the Z homepage. There was another french review, URL?

please tell me about anything you think it's worth adding.
