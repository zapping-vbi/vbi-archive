Outstanding issues for the next release
---------------------------------------
	+ GUI for closed caption, program info, etc.
	+ VBI can be opened/closed while running, try (we also need
	some vbi_streamon, vbi_streamoff to suspend temporarily
	streaming while changing inputs or standards).
	+ Configurable Vidmode
	+ Parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ Add to the configure script and to the .spec deps the
		dependency on mp1e (actually RTE) and the mpeg plugin.
	> Release 0.6.0
	+ Add some remote control applet (or sth like that).
	+ Have a copy of the stuff in the "quick bar" in the main menu
	(for keyb navigation)
	+ Key combos for lazy guys like me (channels + mute)
	+ Fullscreen channel tips.
	+ GUI improvements (channel selection, controls, toolbar...)
	+ Screenshot preview.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)
	+ Save control values and restore on startup (per input?).
	> Further...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
