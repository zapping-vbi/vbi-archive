Outstanding issues for the next release (0.6.0)
-----------------------------------------------
	+ Finish parrot buffer for observing parrots.
	+ Find/draw some icons for the parrot buffer plugin.
	+ Fix country size field width.
	+ Reorganize toolbar, etc.

> 0.6.1
	+ extend OSD to allow arbitrary strings, not just CC and ttx.
	+ Add some remote control applet (or sth like that).
	+ Have a copy of the stuff in the "quick bar" in the main menu
	(for keyb navigation)
	+ Key combos for lazy guys like me (channels + mute)
	+ Fullscreen channel tips.
	+ GUI improvements (channel selection, controls, toolbar...),
	channel submenus.
	+ Revamp GUI for closed caption, program info, etc.
	+ Screenshot preview.
	+ Get thumbnails of all tuned channels.
	+ --roottv switch (use Z as screensaver)
	+ Save control values and restore on startup (per channel).
	+ Save screenshots at arbitrary sizes.
	+ Create screenshots/mpeg/ttx dirs if not existant at write time.
	+ In ttx search it will be more newbie friendly to make
	  regexp optional. In progress window emphasis jumps between
	  Cancel and Prev, should be Cancel and Next. Is Cancel correct
	  at the left? And it may be cleaner with an Abort (the search)
	  and a Cancel (the dialog).
	+ In tty gui: The "R" (Reveal) button is unsuitable for i18n,
	  should be "?" (preferably a nice pixmap), and "?" as kbd
	  shortcut. Verify no other language dependant accels exist.
	+ Improve documentation.
	+ Avoid bundle memcpy in MPEG plugin. The V4L unsync warning is
	  useless btw when we get no proper ESD timestamps either. :-(
	+ Make controls move faster with the keyb.
	+ In ttx export: instead of "export dir", chop off and remember
	  the last path entered. Add HTML option "Save Color". Make
	  blockgfx replacement smarter.

> Somewhen...
	+ Do realtime effects to the image, plainly wonderful, see
	http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~fukuchi/rooms/EffecTV/index.html
	? Add a link to http://www.firstlinux.com/articles/zapping.shtml
	  on the Z homepage. There was another french review, URL?

please tell me about anything you think it's worth adding.
