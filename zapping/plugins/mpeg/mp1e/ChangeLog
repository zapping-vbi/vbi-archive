	* ffmpeg: crash due to cpuid bug, updated from ffmpeg cvs.
	* rte/b_mp1e: report audio frame count in audio only mode.
	* b_mp1e: increased audio buffer size to 8 * frame size (similar
	  to mp1e btw.), hope this gives better sync w/esd. Data is more
	  likely new when we read/stamp because encoding is much faster
	  than input, although still far from reliable synching.
	* rte: fixed a typo in destroy sequence causing hangs.
	* mp1e video: missing eof reply.

	* ffmpeg/: Added ffmpeg backend, taken from ffmpeg cvs
	(http://ffmpeg.sf.net). Needs a lot of work, but most modes
	already encode.

2001-08-01	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* video/mpeg1.c: Fixed fifo eof handling.
	* Restored preview, preliminary.
	* Examined the 2001-06-07 bug, is a DC rounding problem,
	  not strictly a bug. Modified the quant calculation.
	  Lets see how that works, then optimize.
	* Restored v4l interface.

2001-07-31	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added optional input fifo wrapper to mp2 encoder.

2001-07-28	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Converted remaining fifos to fifo2.

2001-07-27	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Converted capture fifos to fifo2 in mp1e and rte.
	* Configure checks whether as supports SSE2.

2001-07-18	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Rewrote bstream function
	* Several fixes and improvements in emu
	* Added SSE2 support

2001-07-13	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed video API detection
	* Oops, forgot to clean up SIGTERM

2001-07-12	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Made emu work with pthreads (phew...)
	* Added SSE and 3DNow! support

2001-07-06	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Made ioctls EINTR aware
	* Corrected a B quant typo (post 1.9pre1)
	* Added motion option to rte

2001-07-05	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed global vbuf conflict in rte_test, same correction
	  in video/v4l2.c, just in case

2001-07-02	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added man page

2001-06-22	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	- MC + 704x576 -> segv
	  2001-07-05 can't reproduce
	* gcc 3.0 fixes

2001-06-07	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Restored subtitle recording
	- MC P/B bug still with us :-P

2001-06-05	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Removed all hardcoded image sizes from motion code
	* Some cleanup in motion.c
	* Integration of motion finished (not enabled by default)

2001-06-04	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed B-frame VLC bug
	* Fixed B-motion mb skipping bug
	* Fixed B-motion PMV bug
	* Fixed MV overflow bug (could be improved)

2001-06-01	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Rewrote configure.in; added config.h
	* Fixed closed_gop B-motion bug
	* Integrating motion, unfinished

2001-05-27	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed rte buffered push capture, removed the possibility of
	deadlock in kill_zombies (the solution isn't optimal,
	though). rte_test works now with all possible combinations for me.
	* YVU support.

2001-05-10	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* Added .spec.in file, mux_thread_done flag for cleaner exit, some
	more fixes to rte/fifos. Lots of useless debugging of mpeg plugin
	segfaults/hanging, cannot isolate the bug yet.

2001-05-07	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Added MC 3.1, not yet compiled in by default, needs testing.
	- MC: stream syntax bug, probably large vectors
	  [-> confirmed, fixed on 2001-06-04]
	- With MC enabled: P/B block bug (quant?), apparently at scene cuts

2001-05-06	<garetxe@users.sf.net>

	* more work on fifos (killing zombies, fixes). Still some bugs
	left.
	* (later) fixed a couple of bugs, plus a purely theoretical one.

2001-04-12	<mschimek@users.sf.net>

	* Fixed p-frame skipped mb bug.
