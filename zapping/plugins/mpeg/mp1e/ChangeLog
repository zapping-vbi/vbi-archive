	* Fixed rte buffered push capture, removed the possibility of
	deadlock in kill_zombies (the solution isn't optimal,
	though). rte_test works now with all possible combinations for me.
	* YVU support.

	* Added .spec.in file, mux_thread_done flag for cleaner exit, some
	more fixes to rte/fifos. Lots of useless debugging of mpeg plugin
	segfaults/hanging, cannot isolate the bug yet.

	* Added MC 3.1, not yet compiled in by default, needs testing.
	- MC: stream syntax bug, probably large vectors
	- With MC enabled: P/B block bug (quant?), apparently at scene cuts

2001-05-06	<garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>

	* more work on fifos (killing zombies, fixes). Still some bugs
	left.
	* (later) fixed a couple of bugs, plus a purely theoretical one.

2001-04-12	<mschimek@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed p-frame skipped mb bug.
