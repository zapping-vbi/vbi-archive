LIRC plugin for zapping by marco.p@bigfoot.com
----------------------------------------------

The plugin liblirc.zapping.so is included, so you don't have to make it.
Copy this file to the zapping plugins directory (~/.zapping/plugins or
/usr/local/lib/zapping/plugins) and start zapping.

If you want to build the plugin you have to copy this directory to
/zapping_source_directory/plugins. Change to this directory an do a
make. The file liblirc.zapping.so will be created in the .libs dir.

In order to use the LIRC plugin the LIRC daemon must be running and the
user must have read/write-access to /dev/lircd.

The buttons you can specify are listed in your lircd.conf file. The button
names are case sensitive.

In the LIRC plugin configuration you can specify, which action should be
executed if you press a certain button. You can specify also button 
sequences with two button names.

Example:

If you have a button called 1 and a button called 2, then you can specify
the following action:

Button name: 1:2
Action: set channel
Number: 12

If you specify such a sequence the button names must be separated by a colon.
