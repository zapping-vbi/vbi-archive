  Introduction
  ============

      Some time ago Iñaki G. Etxebarria, the original author of this
  program, bought a TV card for his computer.  In his Linux box there
  were only a few TV viewing programs, and none of them for Gnome. So
  he built a TV viewer following V4L2 spec (at that time not part of
  stable kernels), trying to make it as complete as possible. This is
  the latest version of that software.

  Requirements
  ============

  Zapping requires an analog TV card, with a driver supporting the
  - V4L or V4L2 API on Linux, or the
  - BKTR API on FreeBSD, or the
  - XVideo API.

  Software:
  - Gnome 2.0, Gtk+ 2.4 libraries.
  - optional libzvbi for Teletext, subtitles and closed caption support,
      Linux and FreeBSD only.
  - optional librte for recording, Linux only.
  - optional liblirc for remote controls, Linux only.

  Download
  ========

  Zapping, libzvbi and librte are available from

    http://zapping.sourceforge.net

  Installation
  ============

  From CVS:

    ./autogen.sh (configure options) && make

  From tarball:

    ./configure (options) && make
