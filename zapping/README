Zapping - The Gnome TV viewer
-----------------------------
	OK, here it is.
	Some time ago I bought a TV card for my computer. In my Linux
box there were only a few TV viewing programs, and none of them for
Gnome. So I build a TV viewer following V4L2 spec (not compiled into
the Kernel by default) from scratch, but trying to make it as complete
as possible.

INSTALLING
----------
	To install this package just run './configure', 'make', and
as root 'make install'. That will install Zapping in your computer. It
won't create any icon, thought, but you can run it as 'zapping &'.
	You will need also V4L2 correctly installed, and Gnome, of
course ;-)

PROGRAM INFO
------------
	The program stores its configuration in a file called
~/.zappingrc. That means that Zapping will read any options from that
file, that has XML format, so it is human-readable. (For the novice,
~/.zappingrc means that if your home directory is /home/garetxe, then
the file will be called /home/garetxe/.zappingrc).
	Currently, in my PII 350, the best results are with a 16 bit
screen depth. With a maximized 800x600 window I get just a 60%-90% CPU
usage. With higher depths, the capture process is slower, and the best
size I can get before going 100% CPU usage is about 600x400.
	Interlaced mode allows you for higher resolutions, but the
image can get somewhat blurry if there is a lot of movement in the
screen. You can reduce a lot this blurryness by using a window size
that keeps standard TV dimensions (about 640x480 in PAL modes).
	The fullscreen mode uses framebuffer access. For using it,
root privileges are needed. I created a small SUID program that sets
up everything and returns. There is a potential secutiry flaw here (i
tried to make it secure, but don't trust it very much), so if you
really care about security, you may
	a) Uninstall the program (check its location with 
		'whereis zapping_setup_fb').
	    You won't have fullscreen mode then, but there would be no
	    security flaw.
	b) Check the suid's sources and locate the security flaws.
	   Drop me a line and in a couple of hours since i read the
	   message it will be fixed (this is the preferred method ;-)
	SUID root: it means that the program, when executed, will be
given root privileges, even if the user isn't root (don't smile, when
i came into Linux from Windoze, i kept wondering what where that
marvellous suid programs able to hack every Unix system)

	Well, this isn't related to this program, but this WM is
	really great (with a bit of programming knowledge you can make
	miracles out of this)

CONTACTING
----------
	You can direct any questions, dead threats, lost puppies,
money you don't want and used books in Languages I don't know but
would like to learn (Hebrew, to put an example) to 
<garetxe@euskalnet.net> (This address can be changed if I put the
project into SourceForge).

	thanks and enjoy the TV (as difficult as that might seem),
