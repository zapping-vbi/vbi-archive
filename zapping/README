Zapping - The Gnome TV viewer
-----------------------------
	OK, here it is.
	Some time ago I bought a TV card for my computer. In my Linux
box there were only a few TV viewing programs, and none of them for
Gnome. So I build a TV viewer following V4L2 spec (not compiled into
the Kernel by default) from scratch, but trying to make it as complete
as possible.

INSTALLING
----------
	To install this package just run './configure', 'make', and
as root 'make install'. That will install Zapping in your computer. It
won't create any icon, thought, but you can run it as 'zapping &'.

PROGRAM INFO
------------
	The program stores its configuration in a file called
~/.zappingrc. That means that Zapping will read any options from that
file, that has XML format, so it is human-readable. (For the novice,
~/.zappingrc means that if your home directory is /home/garetxe, then
the file will be called /home/garetxe/.zappingrc).
	Currently, in my PII 350, the best results are with a 16 bit
screen depth. With a maximized 800x600 window I get just a 60%-90% CPU
usage. With higher depths, the capture process is slower, and the best
size I can get before going 100% CPU usage is about 600x400.
	Interlaced mode allows you for higher resolutions, but the
image can get somewhat blurry if there is a lot of movement in the
screen. You can reduce a lot this blurryness by using a window size
that keeps standard TV dimensions (about 640x480 in PAL modes).
	The fullscreen mode uses framebuffer access. For using it,
root privileges are needed. I created a small SUID program that sets
up everything and returns. There is a potential secutiry flaw here (i
tried to make it secure, but don't trust it very much), so if you
really care about security, you may
	a) Uninstall the program (check its location with 
		'whereis zapping-setup-fb').
	    You won't have fullscreen mode then, but there would be no
	    security flaw.
	b) Check the suid's sources and locate the security flaws.
	   Drop me a line and in a couple of hours since i read the
	   message it will be fixed (this is the preferred method ;-)
	SUID root: it means that the program, when executed, will be
given root privileges, even if the user isn't root (don't smile, when
i came into Linux from Windoze, i kept wondering what where that
marvelloous suid programs able to hack every Unix system)

	Well, this isn't related to this program, but this WM is
	really great.

	You can direct any questions, dead threats, lost puppies,

would like to learn (Hebrew, to put an example) to

	thanks and enjoy the TV (as difficult as that might seem),

Plugin writer's help (as of 24-2-2000)
--------------------
I'm not going to add much more functionality to the "core"
zapping. Extra features should be coded as plugins, so the app gets
easier to maintain and to work on. This file describes how to write
one of those plugins for zapping.

Plugin API
----------

-- Not described yet, see test_plugin.c (not distributed, look below) --

Where will zapping look for plugins
-----------------------------------
Zapping will only try to load files that have the ".zapping.so" string
in their name. It will look for these files in the following dirs (in
this order):

 * Paths listed under the LD_LIBRARY env var.
 * Paths extracted from the /etc/ld.so.conf file
 * /usr/lib
 * /lib
 * $HOME/.zapping_plugins

Notes
-----

Any plugin must have some exported funcions with some given names, so
zapping can communicate with the plugin. You can see how it works in
the test plugin (not included yet in the standard zapping
distribution, ask me (garetxe@users.sourceforge.net) for it for the
moment).

For more info regarding how to build or use any plugin, please contact
me <garetxe@users.sourceforge.net>
