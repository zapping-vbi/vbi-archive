Zapping - The Gnome TV viewer
-----------------------------
	OK, here it is.
	Some time ago I bought a TV card for my computer. In my Linux
box there were only a few TV viewing programs, and none of them for
Gnome. So I built a TV viewer following V4L2 spec (not compiled into
the Kernel by default) from scratch, but trying to make it as complete
as possible. This is version 0.5.0 of that software.

INSTALLING
----------
	To install this package just run './configure', 'make', and
as root 'make install'. That will install Zapping in your computer. It
won't create any icon, thought, but you can run it as 'zapping &'.

PROGRAM INFO
------------
	* XFree notes:
	In releases of XFree prior to 4.0, if you capture with a
screen depth over 16bpp, CPU usage jumps to 100%. This is actually a
XFree thing, and it is solved with XFree 4.0. But fullscreen mode
won't work with XF4.0, because DGA doesn't work by default.
	The fullscreen mode uses framebuffer access. For using it,
root privileges are needed. I created a small SUID program that sets
up everything and returns. There is a potential secutiry flaw here (i
tried to make it secure, but don't trust it very much), so if you
really care about security, you may:
	a) Uninstall the program (check its location with 
		'whereis zapping_setup_fb').
	    You won't have fullscreen mode then, but there would be no
	    security flaw.
	b) Check the suid's sources and locate the security flaws.
	   Drop me a line and in a couple of hours since i read the
	   message it will be fixed (this is the preferred method ;-)
