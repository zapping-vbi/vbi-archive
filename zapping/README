Zapping - A GNOME TV viewer
---------------------------
	OK, here it is.
	Some time ago I bought a TV card for my computer. In my Linux
box there were only a few TV viewing programs, and none of them for
Gnome. So I built a TV viewer following V4L2 spec (not compiled into
the Kernel by default) from scratch, but trying to make it as complete
as possible. This is the last version of that software.

INSTALLING
----------
	To install this package just run as a normal user:
./configure && make
	And as root:
make install
	Type './configure --help' for extra options you can give to
the configure script.

PROGRAM INFO
------------
	* XFree notes:
	In releases of XFree prior to 4.0, if you capture with a
screen depth over 16bpp, CPU usage jumps to 100%. This is actually a
XFree thing, and it is solved with XFree 4.0. But fullscreen mode
won't work with XF4.0, because DGA doesn't work by default with some
drivers. This is usually fixed with XF4.0.1 (at least it fixed it for me).
	The fullscreen mode uses framebuffer access. For using it,
root privileges are needed. I created a small SUID program that sets
up everything and returns. There is a potential secutiry flaw here (i
tried to make it secure, but don't trust it very much), so if you
really care about security, you may:
	a) Uninstall the program (check its location with 
		'whereis zapping_setup_fb').
	    You won't have fullscreen mode then, but there would be no
	    security flaw.
	b) Check the suid's sources and locate the security flaws.
	   Drop me a line and in a couple of hours since i read the
	   message it will be fixed (this is the preferred method ;-)

FEEDBACK and TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------
	Please read the included BUGS file. If your bug is there, i
probably know about it, but feedback on them is very appreciated. If
they are still there it is because i don't know how to fix them or i
cannot reproduce them, so i need your help.
	Disabling things can be useful, run 'zapping --help' to see
what can be disabled (the "--no-" options at the end).
I need feedback specially on these bugs:
*) Preview doesn't work, image through all screen:
	- Use the command line --bpp option giving the real X
	server depth. Usually 24 or 32 if you have this problem.

*) The program just hangs after showing the main window.
	I have experienced this one myself with a 2.4.0test8
	kernel, and appearently it gets fixed in the 5.4 release. I
	would really appreciate some feedback on this one.

*) Teletext just shows loading..., no page ever loaded
	Try using the --old-bttv option, it fixes the problem for some
	people. The code i'm using for decoding teletext comes from
	AleVT, check with it before reporting a bug. If AleVT doesn't
	work either, there's little I can do, sorry. But the original
	AleVT author will appreciate your reports, though ;-) Links below.

*) The camera/dvd player/whatever connected to Composite uses
NTSC/SECAM/..., and the image appears horribly distorted/colorless/...
	That's because PAL is being used for those inputs. Use the
	--tunerless-norm option to set the norm for those inputs. You
	might switch to V4L2, since it doesn't have this limitation.
