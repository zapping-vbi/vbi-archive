    <h3><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
    Zapzilla kindly allows you to take snapshots of Teletext and
    Closed Caption pages in a plurality of formats. To save the page
    displayed in a window, select Export or Zapzilla / Export from
    the <a href="todo">context menu</a> and the desired format. Note
    the page is saved as displayed, this includes for example,
    highlighted text after a search operation. 

    <h3><a name="Dialog"></a>Export Dialog</h3>
    <img src="export_dialog.png" alt="The Export dialog" align=
    "right"> Zapping composes a file name for you, made of the
    export directory selected under Preferences / VBI&nbsp;options,
    the station name if known, the page number and an extension
    suitable for the format. Naturally you can modify the name,
    choose one from the history or browse your file system. 

    <p>The options are dynamically added, depending on the format.
    All settings are saved across sessions. See below for a
    detailed description.</p>

    <h3><a name="HTML"></a>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h3>
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"><font size="-1">HTML
    specification</font></a> 

    <p>Exports the page as a HTML page, that is preformatted text
    in a <tt>fixed spacing typewriter font</tt>. Zapzilla picks
    an encoding which can represent the page most efficiently, for
    example Greek: ISO-8859-7, other characters are encoded as
    Unicode references.</p>

    <p>For those characters not representable even in Unicode, i.e.
    all sorts of graphics characters, you can enter a
    replacement. A single character ("&nbsp;" - space) stands for
    itself, alternatively you can enter the Unicode number in
    decimal ("32") or hexadecimal ("0x20") format.</p>

    <p>HTML can preserve a number of text attributes: Underlined,
    bold, italic style. The &lt;blink&gt; element is used to
    highlight flashing text, however this is a
    <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a> extension
    and will be ignored by other browsers. Foreground and
    background colors are stored by embedding CSS information. You
    must enable Style Sheets in your browser to actually see color.
    Zapzilla creates anchors for URLs and e-mail adresses found in
    Teletext pages, page numbers are not linked.</p>

    <p>The HTML file will include a title displaying the station
    name and page number. To concatenate HTML pages into a larger
    file the dialog offers an option to omit the page header.</p>

    <p>Hebrew and Arabic text is only partially implemented, if you
    have expertise in these fields your help will be greatly
    appreciated.</p>

    <h3><a name="PPM"></a>PPM - Portable PixMap</h3>
    <a href="man:ppm"><font size="-1">PPM manual page</font></a> 

    <p>Export the page as PPM image, in raw (P6) format.</p>

    <p>The font used to render Teletext and Closed Caption pages
    attempts to mimic a real TV. One implication is that a real TV
    doubles the vertical resolution by overlaying the same image on
    both fields of the picture. The dialog includes the option to
    create a picture with correct aspect ratio, however this will
    duplicate every line of the image, doubling its size without
    adding any new information.</p>

    <p>On a further note, a real TV has a pixel clock unlike
    computer monitors, creating rectangular instead of square
    pixels. In other words, the image looks slightly taller than it
    would on a TV.</p>

    <p>Another method to grab the page, you can select a region to
    be copied to the clipboard and paste the image into your
    favourite GNU image manipulation program.</p>

    <h3><a name="PNG"></a>PNG - Portable Network Graphics</h3>
    <a href="man:png"><font size="-1">PNG manual page</font></a>
    Export the page as PNG image, using an 8 bit palette with alpha
    channel. 

    <p>This format contains the same information as PPM.
    Additionally transparency and overlay attributes are preserved
    and the file is much smaller. A title is included, displaying
    the station name and page number. The aspect ratio issue
    discussed in the <a href="#PPM">PPM section</a> applies here as
    well.</p>

    <h3><a name="TXT"></a>TXT - ASCII Text</h3>
    Exports the page as plain ASCII text, stripped of all styles
    and colors. In the nature of things, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew
    and Arabic Teletext pages cannot be useful translated to ASCII.
    Certain national characters may be lost as well. You can
    specify a replacement character as described in the <a href=
    "#HTML">HTML section</a>. 

    <p>To preserve color, enable the insertion of ANSI color escape
    codes. Note this may not work properly within the 4096 color
    space of Teletext Level 2.5 ("HiText"). The converter does not
    know about your terminal, you can set the default foreground
    and background colors or leave them at "any".</p>

    <p>Another method to grab the text of a page, you can select a
    rectangular or wrapping region to be copied to the
    clipboard. Color will be lost.</p>

    <h3><a name="ANSI"></a>ANSI - ANSI Text</h3>
    Same as ASCII, except the encoding is Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1),
    and ANSI colors forced on. 

    <h3><a name="VTX"></a>VTX - VideoTeXt format</h3>
    This is the format used by the VideoteXt Teletext viewer, and
    the vbidecode program included with the bttv driver, to store
    Teletext pages. It has been added for tools importing VTX
    pages. If you wonder, Videotext is the name of Teletext in
    Germany.

    <p>VTX stores pages in raw Teletext Level 1.0 format. This will
    impair Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew and Arabic pages, strip off any
    national characters transmitted at Level 1.5 and the Level
    2.5/3.5 additional colors, styles and graphics. The Zapping
    hyperlinks, ie. page numbers, URLs and e-mail addresses, are
    not preserved.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in developing an XML based successor
    to VTX, please <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=7653">
