<H1>Some questions about this program</H1>
<H4>What is this software for?</H4>
Zapping is a TV viewer, so displaying TV is its main
goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of things that can be done to a
image stream, and Zapping provides a way to do them, you just need a
plug-in that fits your particular needs. If such a plug-in doesn't
exist, you are encouraged to write one.
<H4>I miss feature XYZ, will it be implemented?</H4>
Probably. The sooner you ask for it, the more probabilities it will
have of being included in the next release.
<H4>It doesn't work!?</H4>
It does for me ;-)<br>
When <a
href="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/index.html#Bugs">reporting</a>
the bug check that it isn't a known one
(check the file <i>BUGS</i> that comes with Zapping), and include as
much info as possible (if there is a crash include the backtrace too).
<br>
<ul>
<li><i>When fullscreen the image doesn't use the whole screen.</i><br>
That usually means that you are using a high resolution. Tell the X
server that you want to use a smaller resolution apart from the usual
one (in /etc/X11/XF86Config or maybe using Xconfigurator or a similar
program, such as Sax2 under Suse).<br>
After doing this you will be able to switch to any appropiate mode
with &lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;ALT&gt; + &lt;KP_+/KP_-&gt;.
<li><i>Fullscreen and preview modes show a very distorted image</i><br>
The usual cause for this is that Zapping couldn't guess correctly the
BPP the X Server is using internally. This is quite common in 24/32
bpp modes, since there's no way I'm aware of to get the real bpp. Try
using the command line --bpp switch.
<li><i>I have a NTSC camera connected to S-Video, but PAL is used.</i><br>
This is a flaw in the V4L spec. You can workaround it by passing the
standard you want to use for tunerless inputs as a command line option
to Zapping. For example:<br>
<i>zapping -n SECAM</i><br>
<b>Note:</b> This is just a workaround, and it will only work if you
have at least one input with a tuner.
</ul>
<H4>How can I help?</H4>
The preferred way is with translations, patches and plugins.
Drop me a line if you want to help.
<H4>Can you give a concise description of this program?</H4>
Zapping is a TV viewer for Gnome. It is also a convenient framework
for getting and processing the image stream from the TV source (e.g. a
Webcam connected to your V4L device, or the teletext from vtx
devices).
