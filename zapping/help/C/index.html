<H1>Some questions about this program</H1>
<H4>What is this software for?</H4>
Zapping is a TV viewer, so displaying TV is its main goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of things that can be done to a image stream, and Zapping provides a way to do them, you just need a plug-in that fits your particular needs. If such a plug-in doesn't exist, you are encouraged to write one.
<H4>How much work is going to be put into Zapping?</H4>
The necessary. I am going to work hard into making Zapping good, fast and without bugs. I am going to write too some demonstrative plugins, to show what can be done with the program.<br>From that moment, my work will be only a maintenance work, so I can move to other projects. New cool features should be implemented as plug-ins, and that's up to you, Open Source hackers.
<H4>I miss feature XYZ, will it be implemented?</H4>
Probably. The sooner you ask for it, the more probabilities it will have of being included in the next release.
<H4>How can I help?</H4>
In a thousand ways. The preferred way is with patches, plug-ins, translations, artwork, web page design and/or maintenance and better GUI design. Of course, encouragement and criticism are also welcome.
<H4>Can you stop asking questions and give a concise description of this program?</H4>
Zapping is a TV viewer for Gnome. It is also a convenient framework for getting and processing the image stream from the TV source (e.g. a Webcam connected to your V4L device, or the teletext from vtx devices).
