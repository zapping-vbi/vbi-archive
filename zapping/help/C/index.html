<H1>Some questions about this program</H1>
<H4>What is this software for?</H4>
Zapping is a TV viewer, so displaying TV is its main
goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of things that can be done to a
image stream, and Zapping provides a way to do them, you just need a
plug-in that fits your particular needs. If such a plug-in doesn't
exist, you are encouraged to write one.
<H4>How much work is going to be put into Zapping?</H4>
The necessary. I am going to work hard into making Zapping good, fast
and without bugs. I am going to write too some demonstrative plugins,
to show what can be done with the program.<br>From that moment, my
work will be only a maintenance work, so I can move to other
projects. New cool features should be implemented as plug-ins, and
that's up to you, Open Source hackers.
<H4>I miss feature XYZ, will it be implemented?</H4>
Probably. The sooner you ask for it, the more probabilities it will
have of being included in the next release.
<H4>It doesn't work!?</H4>
It does for me ;-)<br>
When <a
href="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/index.html#Bugs">reporting</a>
the bug check that it isn't a known one
(<i>/usr/doc/zapping/BUGS</i>), and include as much info as possible
(if there is a crash include the backtrace too).
<br>
<ul>
<li><i>The image doesn't use the whole screen.</i><br>
That usually means that you are using a high resolution. Tell the X
server that you want to use a smaller resolution apart from the usual
one (in /etc/X11/XF86Config or maybe using Xconfigurator or a similar program).
<li><i>What are you talking about? There's no menu option for
that!</i><br>
Actually, there is. It's just that it hides itself if no Direct Video
(DGA) capabilities are found for the current X server, or the TV card
doesn't provide a preview mode.
<li><i>The screen goes blank, but nothing appears.</i><br>
That's a bug, please report it</a>.
<li><i>When starting it prints /dev/dsp busy and stops working.</i><br>
That's a bug too. I'm specially interested in your libesd version
(<i>esd-config --version</i>).
<li><i>Could not load zapping.glade, document not well formed.</i><br>
This probably means that zapping.glade couldn't be found. That's a bug
that should be fixed with 0.5.2, if it isn't, then report it (with the
location where zapping.glade has been installed).
<li><i>Preview mode sucks!</i><br>
I agree with you 100%. Use fullscreen when just watching TV and
capture when doing something else. A windowed preview mode just
doesn't make sense, but a lot of people have asked for it.
</ul>
<H4>How can I help?</H4>
In a thousand ways. The preferred way is with translations, patches
and plugins. Of course, encouragement and criticism are also welcome.
<H4>Can you give a concise description of this program?</H4>
Zapping is a TV viewer for Gnome. It is also a convenient framework
for getting and processing the image stream from the TV source (e.g. a
Webcam connected to your V4L device, or the teletext from vtx
devices).
