This dialog provides a way to select the TV channels available in your
country.<p>
You should first select the country you are in (or the one nearest to
you).<br>
The list on the left side of the dialog should update to reflect all
the available names for frequencies in the selected country. Now you
should try to find the frequencies for the stations available in your
country from the list (by hand, there's no autotuning, sorry).<br>
If you find one, introduce an alias for it in the Text Entry and hit
Enter, or press add.<br>
Use the remove button to get rid of invalid entries. First select the
entries you want to remove from the list on the right and hit
remove.<p>
When you are done, press OK, or hit Cancel if you want to discard the
changes.
