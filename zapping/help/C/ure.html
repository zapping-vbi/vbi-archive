<h1>Unicode and Regular Expressions</h1>
<h2>Version 0.5</h2>
</center>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Regular expressions are a powerful way to search certain patterns in a
text. Apart of simply giving the text you want to find, you can
build a set of rules to be matched, this allows for a much more
powerful search. There's a much comprehensive introduction to regular
expressions in the manual: <br><b>man 7 regex</b>
<h3>Credit where credit is due</h3>
I've ripped most of the Unicode regex code from Mark Leishner's
wonderful URE package, you can find it in
<a
href="http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/">http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/</a>.
But please direct any comments of bugs to <a
href="mailto:garetxe@users.sourceforge.net">me</a> instead, please.
<h3>Usage</h3>
From the README:<br>
This is a simple regular expression package for matching against Unicode text
in UCS2 form.  The implementation of this URE package is a variation on the
RE->DFA algorithm done by Mark Hopkins (markh@csd4.csd.uwm.edu).  Mark
Hopkins' algorithm had the virtue of being very simple, so it was used as a
model.

<pre>
Assumptions:

  o  Regular expression and text already normalized.

  o  Conversion to lower case assumes a 1-1 mapping.

Definitions:

  Separator - any one of U+2028, U+2029, '\n', '\r'.

Operators:
  .   - match any character.
  *   - match zero or more of the last subexpression.
  +   - match one or more of the last subexpression.
  ?   - match zero or one of the last subexpression.
  ()  - subexpression grouping.

  Notes:

    o  The "." operator normally does not match separators, but a flag is
       available for the ure_exec() function that will allow this operator to
       match a separator.

Literals and Constants:

  c       - literal UCS2 character.
  \x....  - hexadecimal number of up to 4 digits.
  \X....  - hexadecimal number of up to 4 digits.
  \u....  - hexadecimal number of up to 4 digits.
  \U....  - hexadecimal number of up to 4 digits.

Character classes:

  [...]           - Character class.
  [^...]          - Negated character class.
  \pN1,N2,...,Nn  - Character properties class.
  \PN1,N2,...,Nn  - Negated character properties class.

  POSIX character classes recognized:

    :alnum:
    :alpha:
    :cntrl:
    :digit:
    :graph:
    :lower:
    :print:
    :punct:
    :space:
    :upper:
    :xdigit:

  And a Unicode specific character class:
    :title:

Aliases
  #url# -> Any internet address (http://www.nowhe.re). Expands to
	"https?://([:alnum:]|[-~./?%_=+])+"
  #email# -> Email address (somebody@somebody.sth). Expands to
	"([:alnum:]|[-~.])+@([:alnum:]|[-~.])+"

  Notes:

    o  Character property classes are \p or \P followed by a comma separated
       list of integers between 1 and 32.  These integers are references to
       the following character properties:

        N	Character Property
        --------------------------
	1	_URE_ALNUM
	2	_URE_ALPHA
	3	_URE_CNTRL
	4	_URE_DIGIT
	5	_URE_GRAPH
	6	_URE_LOWER
	7	_URE_PRINT
	8	_URE_PUNCT
	9	_URE_SPACE
	10	_URE_UPPER
	11	_URE_XDIGIT
	12	_URE_TITLE
	13	_URE_DEFINED
	14	_URE_WIDE
	15	_URE_NONSPACING

    o  Character classes can contain literals, constants, and character
       property classes. Example:

       [abc\U10A\p1,3,4]
