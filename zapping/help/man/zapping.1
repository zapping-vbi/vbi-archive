.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Zapping is a program to watch TV on a computer, within the Gnome environment\&. You can take screenshots and record video and audio\&. Zapping has a Teletext viewer built in and supports Closed Caption and Teletext subtitles\&. It is extensible through plugins\&. For more information open the Gnome help and choose Applications -> Sound and Video -> Zapping\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB-b, --bpp \fINUMBER\fR\fR
Color depth of the X display\&. In TrueColor mode (24 or 32 bits per pixel) you might get a very distorted image that spreads all around the desktop\&. This usually means Zapping could not correctly determine the color depth, which can be given here\&.

.TP
\fB-c, --command \fICOMMAND\fR\fR
Execute the given command and exit\&. This was intended to create a sort of batch mode\&. Currently only one command is implemented\&. In the future this option will probably be replaced by a lightweight tool to control Zapping remotely\&. The \fBset_channel\fR command allows to change the channel by giving the channel name or RF channel number, for example:

zapping -c "set_channel BBC"

.TP
\fB--console-errors\fR
Redirect the error messages to the console, useful for bug reports\&.

.TP
\fB-d, --debug\fR
Print debug messages on standard output\&. You should include this information when submitting a bug report, as it can help to trace the problem\&.

.TP
\fB--device \fIFILENAME\fR\fR
Kernel video device to use, usually \fI/dev/video\fR\&.

.TP
\fB--dword-align\fR
Forces doubleword alignment of the video in overlay mode\&. Can help when the image is distorted at certain sizes but looks fine at others\&.

.TP
\fB-n, --tunerless-norm \fISTRING\fR\fR
This option has no function but is recognized for compatibility with earlier versions of Zapping\&. It determined the video standard to be used when your TV card has no tuner, one of NTSC, PAL or SECAM\&.

.TP
\fB--no-overlay, --remote\fR
Do not overlay video\&. The \fB--remote\fR option refers to the X display\&. Overlay is only possible if the graphics card connects to the same bus as the TV card\&.

.TP
\fB--no-plugins\fR
Do not use any plugins, usually for testing purposes\&.

.TP
\fB--no-vbi\fR
Do not capture and decode VBI data, i\&.e\&. Teletext, Subtitles, Closed Caption and station names\&.

.TP
\fB--no-xv-video\fR
Do not use the XVideo extension for video overlay\&.

.TP
\fB--no-xv-image\fR
Do not use the XVideo extension for hardware image scaling\&.

.TP
\fB-v, --no-xv\fR
Do not use the XVideo extension for video overlay or hardware image scaling\&.

.TP
\fB--xv-image-port \fINUMBER\fR\fR
Number of the XVideo port to use for hardware image scaling\&.

.TP
\fB--xv-port \fINUMBER\fR, --xv-video-port \fINUMBER\fR\fR
Number of the XVideo port (similar to a device) to use for video overlay\&.

.TP
\fB-y, --yuv-format \fISTRING\fR\fR
This option has no function but is recognized for compatibility with earlier versions of Zapping\&. It determined the pixel format in capture mode when XVideo hardware image scaling was available, either YUYV or YVU420\&.

.TP
\fB-z, --no-zsfb\fR
This option has no function but is recognized for compatibility with earlier versions of Zapping\&. It used to prevent execution of \fBzapping_setup_fb\fR(1) on startup\&.
