.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBzapping_setup_fb\fR is a small program intended to be installed as suid root that sets up the Framebuffer\&. If you have pam installed, it can be pam'ified too\&.

.SH "PURPOSE"

.PP
Overlaying TV in the video ram requires the driver to know the destination address in memory\&. To set this value root permissions are needed, this is why \fBzapping_setup_fb\fR needs this level of privileges\&. I've tried to make it secure, but better don't trust it very much\&.
