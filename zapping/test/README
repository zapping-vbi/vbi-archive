This directory contains tools and scripts to test libtv image
manipulation routines.

File overview
-------------

clear_image/clear_image.c/pixel.h/clear_image-mmx|sse.sh
	Tests all implementations of the tv_clear_image() function.
	Run by make check for all compiled implementations.  May use an
	emulator if we cross-compile or the CPU lacks the required feature.

cpudt/cpudt.c
	CPU feature detection.  Use like "if cpudt mmx; then ..."
	Possible features are mmx, 3dnow, sse, sse2, altivec and
	others.  Used by simd-emu.sh.

guard1.c/guard2.c/guard.h
	Miniature version of efence, to check for buffer overflows
	during tests, and two test for mini-efence itself.

memcpy/memcpy.c/memcpy-mmx|sse.sh
	Tests all implementations of the tv_memcpy() function.
	Run by make check for all compiled implementations.  May use an
	emulator if we cross-compile or the CPU lacks the required feature.

simd-emu.sh
	Runs a test program using an emulator, currently qemu, if our CPU
	does not support the required feature.  Used by various scripts.

simd/simd.c/simd-mmx|3dnow|sse|sse2|altivec.sh
	Tests if the libtv/simd.h macros do what they are supposed to.
	Run by make check for all compilable implementations.  May use an
	emulator if we cross-compile or the CPU lacks the required feature.
