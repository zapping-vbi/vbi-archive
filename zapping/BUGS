Known bugs with zapping
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	! Sometimes Zapping starts at minimum size, when it
shouldn't (i'm trying to find a pattern for it, i've no idea of what
the problem is) (Note: This doesn't happen now, maybe it's fixed).
	* Somehow the docs aren't displayed with the GnomeHelpBrowser
but with Mozilla. Annoying, since Mozilla needs a lot of resources.
	* Some users have reported that FS mode doesn't work
correctly. Add support for the vidmode extension and add some debug
messages to find out what's happening (done, now wait for bug reports).
