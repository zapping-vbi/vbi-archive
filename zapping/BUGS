Known bugs with zapping, don't report them
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
	* Capture won't work under PPC (endianess)
	* Zapzilla: No fallback on incomplete DRCS page?
	~ Zapzilla: Calls fetch_page more often than necessary,
	  investigate.
	~ Zapzilla: what's v4lx doing on standard change?
	* Look for endianness problems.
	* CC to be checked.
	* Prefs can be opened multiple times and the mpeg
          plugin doesn't like it. Is there some idea behind
          multiple preferences or is the plugin right?
	* Mpeg plugin/mp1e rc when promoting frames broke.
