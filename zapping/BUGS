Known bugs with zapping, don't report them
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	! Z crashes randomly with a segv. I cannot reproduce, but
	happens at times, even when i'm doing nothing with it. I wish
	i could get a backtrace.
	! Sometimes segv when doing:
		start in capture mode, middle-click to fs,
		middle-click to restore.
	* MPEG a+v sync sucks big rocks (maybe just because my CPU is too
	  slow, but then it's still a bug in mhs' opinion.)
        * rte seems to sometimes drop encoded frames in a+v mode,
	  needs investigation.
	* Need better handling of no /dev/video0.
	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
	* The standard is changed when changing modes (check, not sure)
	* Capture won't work under PPC (endianess)
