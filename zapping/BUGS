------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------
	
	! Something leaks horribly every n-milliseconds, memprof says
	it's x11_add_clips. Weird, but needs fixing.
	! Segfault when pasting text under certain circunstances,
	needs investigation.
	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	! Sometimes the program hangs when exiting (i cannot reproduce
	this now, maybe it's fixed?)
	* The standard is changed when changing modes.
