* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------
	
	! Windowed mode doesn't detect the "anti-expose (cover)" event
- how does xawtv do it?
	* When viewing Teletext, we shouldn't use ERC, but we should
for the rest. Make it configurable.
	* Add support in TVeng for tuner-less cards.
	* Some (broken :-/) X Servers work in 24bpp mode while the
default visual is 32 bpp, or viceversa. This stops Capture and Preview
from working both correctly at the same time. Work around this.
	* YUV support is needed for using TVeng with Xv.
	! If we use V4L2 controllers with VBI, they crash. Add support
in libvbi for the V4L2 api (or something like that).
