Known bugs with zapping, don't report them
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
	* Capture won't work under PPC (endianess)
	* Zapzilla: No fallback on incomplete DRCS page?
	~ Zapzilla: Calls fetch_page more often than necessary,
	  investigate.
	~ Zapzilla: what's v4lx doing on standard change?
	* Look for endianness problems.
	* CC to be checked.
	* Disabling vbi decoding leaves last known station
          name from vbi on display.
	* Mpeg plugin/mp1e rc when promoting frames broke.
	* Mpeg plugin/mp1e frame skipping method 2&3 don't work.
	* Mpeg plugin/mp1e very low frame rate interrupts display,
	  probably a scheduling issue. Investigate if/how this can be avoided.
	* When I set recording size 176x144 the image is garbled,
	  both displayed and recorded, apparently due to incorrect scan
	  line pitch. Happened with my driver and the v4l2 sample driver
	  alike, so I suspect a bug in the capture routines.
	! With very bad signal i often get:
zapping: fifo.c:684: send_full_buffer called from /home/garetxe/cvs/zapping/libvbi/v4lx.c:1029: Assertion "!p->eof_sent" failed
Abortado
