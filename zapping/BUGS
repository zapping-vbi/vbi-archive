Known bugs with zapping
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	! Doesn't restore Vidmode correctly when returning from
fullscreen.
	! It sometimes gives a segfault when exitting
(lookup(tv_screen) returns NULL)
	! Windowed mode doesn't detect the "anti-expose (cover)" event
- how does xawtv do it?
	! Find the cause for those /dev/dsp busy error messages (libesd
<= 0.2.8 broken?)
	! Various (possible) leaks in the X code.
	* The clips and the window in V4L are quite "personal"
	* Add support in TVeng for tuner-less cards.
	* YUV support if i have the time.
	* Somehow the docs aren't displayed with the GnomeHelpBrowser
but with Mozilla. Annoying, since Mozilla needs a lot of resources.
