Known bugs with zapping
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	! Marcel Janssen reported that with a bt878 Zapping didn't
work when resizing the window to a size bigger that the maximum
capture dimensions (the V4L1 bug with maximum capture sizes worked
around in xawtv?)
	* Somehow the docs aren't displayed with the GnomeHelpBrowser
but with Mozilla. Annoying, since Mozilla needs a lot of resources.
	* Some users have reported that FS mode doesn't work
correctly. Add support for the vidmode extension and add some debug
messages to find out what's happening (done, now wait for bug reports).
