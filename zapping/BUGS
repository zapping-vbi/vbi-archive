* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------
	
	! Something leaks horribly every n-milliseconds, memprof says
	it's x11_add_clips. Weird, but needs fixing.
	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* TTX cursor keys increment an old page number after
	  jumping to a FLOF/TOP/nnn linked page.
	* Sometimes the geometry isn't correctly restored at startup.
	! Sometimes the program hangs when exiting.
	* The input (and probably the standard) are changed when
	changing modes.
