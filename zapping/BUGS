Known bugs with zapping
-----------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------

	! Sometimes Zapping starts at minimum size, when it
shouldn't (i'm trying to find a pattern for it, i've no idea of what
the problem is)
	* In the plugin dialog, text widget shows the end with long
descriptions (will be fixed in 0.5.1).
	* Somehow the docs aren't displayed with the GnomeHelpBrowser
but with Mozilla. Annoying, since Mozilla needs a lot of resources.
	* The geometry isn't kept, probably a libglade bug.
	* Some users have reported that FS mode doesn't work
correctly. Add support for the vidmode extension and add some debug
messages to find out what's happening.
