Known bugs with zapping
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	! Doesn't restore Vidmode correctly when returning from fullscreen.
	! Find the cause for those /dev/dsp busy error messages (libesd
<= 0.2.8 broken?)
	* Add support in TVeng for tuner-less cards.
	* YUV support if i have the time.
	* Somehow the docs aren't displayed with the GnomeHelpBrowser
but with Mozilla. Annoying, since Mozilla needs a lot of resources.
	* Some users have reported that FS mode doesn't work
correctly. Add support for the vidmode extension and add some debug
messages to find out what's happening (done, now wait for bug reports)
(a month without bug reports, probably it works now).
