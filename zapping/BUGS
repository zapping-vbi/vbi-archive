Known bugs with zapping, don't report them
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	! Z crashes randomly with a segv. I cannot reproduce, but
	happens at times, even when i'm doing nothing with it. I wish
	i could get a backtrace.
	! Sometimes segv when doing:
		start in capture mode, middle-click to fs,
		middle-click to restore [probably parrot plugin].
	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
	* The standard is changed when changing modes (check, not sure)
	* Capture won't work under PPC (endianess)
	* Zapzilla: DRCS/double height char mistake on SWR?
	* Zapzilla: No fallback on incomplete DRCS page?
	* Zapzilla: Investigate RTC offset 41-8 instead of 41-9?
	* Don't compile conv_gen.s if $host != x86
