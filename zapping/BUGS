Known bugs with zapping, don't report them

* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------
	
	! Something leaks horribly every n-milliseconds, memprof says
	it's x11_add_clips. Weird, but needs fixing.
	! There's a possible SEGFAULT in the TTXView, it happens if a
	page is being received, and we monitor it. The monitor
	function finds it in the cache, but it isn't complete, and the
	ext field points to somewhere in the computer limbo.
	But that's only my guesswork, of course :-)
	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
