------------------------------------------

	! When there's no VBI data available vbi_close can hang
	forever when joining mainloop, which is waiting a buffer that
	will never come. Appears to be bug #459849 (lockup on close).
	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
	* Capture won't work under PPC (endianess)
	* Zapzilla: No fallback on incomplete DRCS page?
	~ Zapzilla: Calls fetch_page more often than necessary,
	  investigate.
	~ Zapzilla: what's v4lx doing on standard change?
	* Look for endianness problems.
	* TTX subpage +- acc don't work in main window.
