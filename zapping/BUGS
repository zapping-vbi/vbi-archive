Known bugs with zapping, don't report them
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	! Z crashes randomly with a segv. I cannot reproduce, but
	happens at times, even when i'm doing nothing with it. I wish
	i could get a backtrace.
	! MPEG plugin does all sort of weird things. Can take several
	seconds to start, sometimes segfaults if a bundle resize is
	involved and the mode is YUYV. Perhaps mcfifos-related, investigate.
	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
	* The standard is changed when changing modes (check, not sure)
	* Capture won't work under PPC (endianess)
	* Zapzilla: No fallback on incomplete DRCS page?
	~ Zapzilla: Calls fetch_page more often than necessary,
	  investigate.
	* Don't compile conv_gen.s if $host != x86
	~ Zapzilla: what's v4lx doing on standard change?
