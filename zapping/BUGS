Known bugs with zapping, don't report them
------------------------------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
------------------------------------------

	* Need better no-overlay-present handling.
	* Capture won't work under PPC (endianess)
	* Look for endianness problems.
	* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
	~ Zapzilla: Calls fetch_page more often than necessary,
	  investigate.
	~ Zapzilla: what's v4lx doing on standard change?
	* Disabling vbi decoding leaves last known station
          name from vbi on display.
	* Mpeg plugin/mp1e very low frame rate interrupts display,
	  probably a scheduling issue. Investigate if/how this can be avoided.
	* When I set recording size 176x144 the image is garbled,
	  both displayed and recorded, apparently due to incorrect scan
	  line pitch. Happened with my driver and the v4l2 sample driver
	  alike, so I suspect a bug in the capture routines.
	* channel editor: input: add tuner;
	  standard: don't change behaves strange.
	  w/o tuner freq display is wrong.
	* sometimes crash at termination.
	* check on_trigger_clicked
	* check html export blink attr
	* Overlay (no XVideo) under E is broken, shading the window
	isn't correctly detected.
	* Do not assert on ESD timeout
