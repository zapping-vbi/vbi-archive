Known bugs with zapping
-----------------------
* == Bug that needs fixing
! == Bug that needs fixing, very important
> == Fixed
------------------------

	! Sometimes Zapping starts at minimum size, when it
shouldn't (i'm trying to find a pattern for it, i've no idea of what
the problem is)
	> 'Colour' in controls seems duplicated (i18n error)
	* In the plugin dialog, text widget shows the end with long
descriptions (will be fixed in 0.5.1).
	> The template widget should be declared 'noinst' in the Makefile.am
	* Some controls appear that don't do anything, check them
before adding.
	* Somehow the docs aren't displayed with the GnomeHelpBrowser
but with Mozilla. Annoying.
	> With V4L2, capture starts giving errors when exec'ing
external programs (actually just worked around).
	> Capture is EXTREMELY SLOW in 24 or 32 bpp modes. Works OK in
16 bit modes. Actually XPutImage is the slow thing, this is fixed in X4.
