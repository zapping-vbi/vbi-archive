Known bugs in Zapping, don't report them
----------------------------------------

Zapping 0.9:
* zapping_remote man page is missing.
* bktr interface needs more work.
* src/tveng1.c/p_tveng1_dequeue/CSYNC hangs with bttv when changing video
  standard PAL NTSC PAL. Timeout SIGALRMs but doesn't EINTR.
* XVideo: pal-m-television -> pal m-television.

Zapping 0.7.2:
* Fullscreen DMA overlay clips subtitles but not context menu and windows.
* bktr: Closing and reopening /dev/bktr, /dev/tuner sometimes fails
  when /dev/vbi is open. Apparently close() does not call the driver
  close function before open(). Strange.

Zapping 0.7 bugs, need more work later:
* Video size isn't always right on startup.
* Spinslider minimum sizes.
* Select composite, quit, restart, back at "television". Problem: channels
  have a video input parameter, and selecting composite does not
  switch the channel, so on restart the channel's input is restored. We
  could have a "null" channel, but what about e.g. ttx bookmarks?
* Prefs does not apply screenshot add toolbar option. Seems to be
  another gtk_widget_show/hide toolbar item problem.
* When a/v recording is started under high system load the
  timestamps may differ too much, triggering the mp1e
  "cannot sync" check and aborting Zapping.
* 2003-11-27 From windowed overlay to fullscreen w/automatic vidmode hang
  on RH at switch_mode (PREVIEW) -> z_set_window_bg -> calloc segv.
  Circumstances might be coincidental, it doesn't happen predictable.
  valgrind --skin=addrcheck was inconclusive:

   Address 0x0 is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd
   No recipient addresses found in header
  Program segv'ed before window opened.
* 0.7 seems to run slower than 0.6, must profile.
* Overlay needs a review.
* Prefs toolbar style menu does not update when config changes
  (should it?) and selection cannot be canceled.
* mpeg plugin doesn't link with libdivx-20030428.
  Undefined reference to __start_cp_handler, __eh_rtime_match.
  g++ doesn't help, no .a|.o|.so found. Where the fsck are they defined??
* Edited channels, clicked ok, tc==NULL in tuned_channel_nth_name().
  Not recently observed, perhaps fixed.
* Mute button is on after unmute, quit, restart. Seems to be a driver
  effect.
* Doesn't always reset hue on startup?
* drose: "Under mdk 9.1 the video capture stops for no reason.
  Start recording to a file -- come back in ten minutes, 1 - 3 minutes
  of video are stored and zapping wasn't running." Works for me.
* Overlay doesn't work right with RANDR reduced resolution, apparently
  due to wrong frame buffer bpl.

Zapping 0.6 bugs, need verification:
* RPM creates incorrect zsfb.capps 
* zsfb.capps conflicts with RPM relocation.
* Look for endianness problems.
* vbi eats too much CPU, investigate.
* Overlay (no XVideo) under E is broken, shading the window
  isn't correctly detected.
* Do not assert on ESD timeout
* Bug in save window geometry, reported by Pawel.

tvengxv.c
* Need to handle BadAtom errors resulting from Xv out
  of video memory (or no v4l device?). Currently gdk traps errors
  and just aborts the App.
* We must not rely on XvQueryPortAttributes(), this is a later
  (XFree86-only?) extension of the XVideo API. It already defines
  some attribute names and ranges, and XvGetPortAttribute() will tell
  if they are implemented by the driver.
* configure.in must check for different versions of xv.

Debian bugs
* 126641 - zapping_remote, see also sf.net. Without X to do.
* 168263 - Feature request, implemented in 0.7.
* 198942 - Open.

Kernel
------
bktr driver:
* Incomplete and broken in many ways, not always possible to work around.
  For details search tvengbktr.c for "Bug".

sn9c102 1.0.8 driver:
* CROPCAP overwrites type (was _IOR, now _IOWR).
* G_INPUT requires cleared index input.
* TRY_FMT does not copy data back to user space.
* ENUM_FMT overwrites type.
* NONBLOCK open fails with EAGAIN if the device has users, and it
  seems the counter is never decremented when the USB device is
  disconnected at close time.
* mmap fails for > 1 buffers, apparently because
  m.offset isn't page aligned.

bttv driver:
* 0.9.14: with YUV 4:2:0 activation of VBI capturing can cause a
  SCERR & driver reset, DQBUF -> EIO.
* bt8x8 has no PAL delay line, or is disabled in YUYV mode?
* tveng2/bttv-0.8.x permits capture size exceeding hardware capability?
* Audio mutes when switching from capture to fullscreen with
  bttv-0.8.x and Xv/v4l, although Zapping sends XvSetPortAttribute
  XV_MUTE 0. Works normal with bttv-0.7.

XFree86/Xorg
------------
* XvQueryAdaptors seems to report wrong num_formats value, maybe a
  DIX or DDX bug.
* XvListImageFormats, XvQueryPortAttributes not documented. Result
  must be XFree()ed.
* XvImageFormat: Some drivers define incorrect component_order.
  There are no Window FOURCCs for RGB formats, consequently drivers
  disagree about id and guid.
* Xinerama & XvQueryAdaptors: Each Xinerama screen may be a different
  graphics card with its own set of Xvideo adaptors and attributes.
  As of X.org 6.7 we cannot query them because the window parameter
  resolves to the virtual screen, not physical screens.
  XvQueryAdaptors always returns the adaptors of the first physical
  screen and Xinerama appears to map these adaptors to physical ones,
  but that works only for XvPutImage and the v4l wrapper (or not).

V4L XVideo driver (xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/v4l/v4l.c)
* Success of ioctls is not checked.
* Does not consider audio.mode changes semantics on read/write.
  V4lSetPortAttribute():
    } else if (attribute == xvMute ||
	       attribute == xvVolume) {
	ioctl(V4L_FD,VIDIOCGAUDIO,&pPPriv->audio);
	if (attribute == xvMute) {
	    if (value)
		pPPriv->audio.flags |= VIDEO_AUDIO_MUTE;
	    else
		pPPriv->audio.flags &= ~VIDEO_AUDIO_MUTE;
	} else if (attribute == xvVolume) {
	    if (pPPriv->audio.flags & VIDEO_AUDIO_VOLUME)
		pPPriv->audio.volume = xv_to_v4l(value);
	} else {
	    ret = BadValue;
	}
	if (ret != BadValue)
	    if (-1 == ioctl(V4L_FD,VIDIOCSAUDIO,&pPPriv->audio))
		perror("ioctl VIDIOCSAUDIO");
* Encoding is not reset on open? Apparently cought when Zapping opens
  the v4l/2/5 interface too (try remove the modules in tveng.c, or
  start xv overlay while a radio app runs).
* Reports wrong tuner frequency range:
  static const XF86AttributeRec FreqAttr =
    {XvSettable | XvGettable,     0, 16*1000, XV_FREQ};
* Ignores tuner frequency scale factor (62.5 Hz, 62.5 kHz). Supposedly
  the Hz scale was added for SW radio, but the V4L/2 spec nowhere says
  tv receivers must support kHz only.
  V4lSetPortAttribute():
  } else if (attribute == xvFreq) {
      if (-1 == ioctl(V4L_FD,VIDIOCSFREQ,&value))
          perror("ioctl VIDIOCSFREQ");
  V4lGetPortAttribute():
  } else if (attribute == xvFreq) {
     ioctl(V4L_FD,VIDIOCGFREQ,value);
* XV_FREQ semantics not documented, e.g. scale 62.5 kHz.
* XvEncodingInfo does not report if the input is a tuner and
  XV_FREQ access appears to succeed on all inputs.
* According to XvQueryPortAttributes() this device has 2001
  video standards and inputs (no, I didn't try them :-)
  {XvSettable | XvGettable, -1000, 1000, XV_ENCODING}

NVidia driver (binary, not xf86)
* Reports tv output port with type XvInputMask | XvVideoMask.
  Should be XvOutputMask. Workaround in place.

NeoMagic driver (xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/neomagic)
* The only port is of type XvInputMask | XvImageMask | XvWindowMask |
  XvOutputMask | XvVideoMask. It supports PutVideo (video in) and
  PutImage (image out), probably not both at once. XvQueryAdaptors man
  page does not state if such a combination of flags has to be
  expected. Actually it doesn't even mention the XvImage extension.

Savage driver (xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/savage/savage_video.c)
* Minor nit: comment says YV12, I420 == 4:1:1, actually 4:2:0. The
  alleged 2:1:1 is really a half width 4:2:2, there's no such thing as 2:1:1.

Glint driver (xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/glint/pm2_video.c)
* Does not list XV_ENCODING with other attributes for
  XvQueryPortAttributes(). Only two other drivers have XV_ENCODING,
  namely V4L and SMI (xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/
  siliconmotion/smi_video.c), and both list it, but I wonder if it
  really belongs with attributes. This is no picture control and the
  info is redundant with XvQueryEncodings(). Workaround in place.

If it ain't broken... it is now.
