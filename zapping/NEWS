New stuff, refer to the ChangeLog for a more detailed description of
the changes.

0.6.5
-----
It's been a long time since 0.6.4, much too long, but finally the
beast arrived. Main change this time is the switch from rte 0.4
to 0.5, our real time audio/video recording library. It adds
a lot more formats besides MPEG-1 using ffmpeg and divx4linux.
Quite likely the number will increase with future releases. Along
with it comes a new recording dialog. New chrome aside users can
now define recording configurations with different names.




* build fixes
* lang updates
* improved recording dialog
* vbi/rte i18n
* Canada cable
* fixes
* New GUI options toolbar style, keep window on top (when
  supporte by window manager), and a few minor improvements.
* Disables XScreensaver
* 

0.6.4
-----
This is mostly a bugfix release, no new features. When you
use this version you should also install zvbi 0.1.1 which
adds more fixes.

0.6.3
-----
A new year, a new release, a new maintainer. Sadly this
release does not include all improvements planned for 0.6.3,
but it's over three months since the last release, without an
end in sight. Future versions will be released at shorter
intervals.

The main difference to 0.6.2 is the extraction of the Zapping vbi
decoder into a separate package "zvbi". Motivation was to clean
up and re-use the component in other applications, encourage more
frequent updates and to reduce the size of binaries. Zapping can
be compiled without, but a lot of functionality depends on the
zvbi library, so you should really get it. Using the binary
packages makes it a requirement.

Other changes:
- Recording source and volume can be selected in preferences.
  Currently only the OSS /dev/mixer is supported.
- For our US and Canadian users Zapping now looks for XDS
  program title, start and end times, rating etc. and can
  display this information in the title bar or a program
  info window.
- Complete rewrite of the screenshot plugin. Better dialog,
  supports JPEG and PPM (possibly more, inquire within), has
  quality preview and on-the-fly deinterlacing.
- Some channel editor improvements.
- The "snapshot button" present on ov511 web cams is scanned
  and does what it's supposed to.
- Pointer disappears and reappears screen-saver style.
- Some Teletext export improvements.
- New mute audio toolbar button.
- Channel numbers can be entered on the numeric keypad, either
  by channel memory number (European style) or RF channel
  number (US style).
- Preliminary volume up/down function.
- Most of the keybord shortcuts are configurable now.
- And the usual set of bug fixes and new bugs.
