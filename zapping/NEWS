New stuff, refer to the ChangeLog for a more detailed description of
the changes.

0.6.7
-----
Fixes a bug in the screenshot plugin, crashing Zapping on exit,
and triggered by the nptl library on RedHat 9. In the RPM it
was unavoidable to require newer versions of libc and libpng.

0.6.6
-----
Hi folks. Following the last Gnome 1 release of Zapping I'm proud
to announce the actual last version. Let's hope 0.7 will be ready
before we need some more last versions.

This version fixes a number of bugs in the previous version,
most notably recording and mute/volume problems.

The V4L2 interface of Linux 2.5 is now supported, new commands
were added to the alirc plugin: MUTE, VOL_UP, VOL_DOWN,
and the SETCHANNEL function improved. The --remote command line
option can be used to disable overlay. Pino Toscano kindly
contributed an Italian translation.

0.6.5
-----
It's been a long time since 0.6.4, much too long, but finally
the beast arrived. Main change this time is the switch from rte 0.4 to
0.5, our high speed audio/video recording library. The recording plugin
will not work with rte 0.4 unless you compile Zapping yourself.

rte 0.5 adds a lot more formats besides MPEG-1 using ffmpeg and divx4linux,
possibly even more in the future. Along with the new codecs comes a new
recording dialog which allows users to save recording configurations
under different names.

RPM changes:
- Some earlier Zapping binaries installed in /usr/local, the default
  when building the application from source. The current binary
  zapping-0.6.5-1.i386.rpm installs in /usr which should integrate better
  in most Linux distributions, including RedHat and Mandrake. The rte
  and zvbi packages always installed in /usr.
- Another binary zapping-0.6.5-1.suse.i386.rpm is provided which
  installs in /opt/gnome, otherwise identical.

Other changes:
- We have new GUI options to change the toolbar style and keep the video
  window on top (when supported by the window manager).
- Zapping temporarily disables XScreensaver, the software screen blanker
  by J. Zawinski. Of course the X11 built-in savers are also disabled.
- Teletext export options and the record plugin codec menus where not
  or not correctly localized in the past (i.e. remaining in English).
  For full satisfaction you may have to update zvbi as well.
- Thanks to Guus Bonnema for taking over maintenance of the orphaned
  Dutch translation.
- Matt without last name contributed a frequency table for Canadian cable.
- Well, and the usual set of fixes, non-fixes and micro improvements.

This is the last release of Zapping (gasp!) using Gnome 1 (phew!). The
next version 0.7 will require Gnome 2, so please stop asking now. If you
like to live on the bleeding edge, the tree is in CVS, branch
zapping-gnome2. It will move to the HEAD trunk at the appropriate time.

0.6.4
-----
This is mostly a bugfix release, no new features. When you
use this version you should also install zvbi 0.1.1 which
adds more fixes.

0.6.3
-----
A new year, a new release, a new maintainer. Sadly this
release does not include all improvements planned for 0.6.3,
but it's over three months since the last release, without an
end in sight. Future versions will be released at shorter
intervals.

The main difference to 0.6.2 is the extraction of the Zapping vbi
decoder into a separate package "zvbi". Motivation was to clean
up and re-use the component in other applications, encourage more
frequent updates and to reduce the size of binaries. Zapping can
be compiled without, but a lot of functionality depends on the
zvbi library, so you should really get it. Using the binary
packages makes it a requirement.

Other changes:
- Recording source and volume can be selected in preferences.
  Currently only the OSS /dev/mixer is supported.
- For our US and Canadian users Zapping now looks for XDS
  program title, start and end times, rating etc. and can
  display this information in the title bar or a program
  info window.
- Complete rewrite of the screenshot plugin. Better dialog,
  supports JPEG and PPM (possibly more, inquire within), has
  quality preview and on-the-fly deinterlacing.
- Some channel editor improvements.
- The "snapshot button" present on ov511 web cams is scanned
  and does what it's supposed to.
- Pointer disappears and reappears screen-saver style.
- Some Teletext export improvements.
- New mute audio toolbar button.
- Channel numbers can be entered on the numeric keypad, either
  by channel memory number (European style) or RF channel
  number (US style).
- Preliminary volume up/down function.
- Most of the keybord shortcuts are configurable now.
- And the usual set of bug fixes and new bugs.

0.6.2
-----
- Dutch translation.
- Redesigned channel editor and properties dialog.
- SGML renderer for OSD.
- In-window OSD, no more floating subtitle windows.
- Support for the Logitech Quickcam Express (possibly
  other quickcams too, but this is untested).
- Improved timestamping.
- ARTS recording support.
- Sync with rte 0.4
- Bugfixes and polishment, as usual.

0.6.1 
-----
- Added Swedish translation.
- Reported to build and work (using XVideo) under FreeBSD and Solaris.
- Automatic overlaying of subtitle TTX pages.
- Reverted to the old fb depth detection routine.
- Some bugfixes in the mpeg plugin, adapted to use rte 0.3.1's new controls api.
- Fixed some bugs with Arabic and Hebrew TTX glyph mapping.
- Usability improvements, especially in the channel editor.
- Updated de, es, fr and pl translations.
