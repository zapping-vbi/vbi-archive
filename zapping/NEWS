New stuff, refer to the ChangeLog for a more detailed description of
the changes.

Zapping 0.10, 2005-09-
------------------------
This version of Zapping improves caption and subtitle support.

- It has a new, more standards compliant Closed Caption decoder.
- Subtitles are now implemented as a plugin with various preferences:
  Scaling/antialiasing mode, text brightness and contrast, Closed Caption
  padding and soft rolling, default foreground and background color,
  Teletext default character set, and an option to shrink double height
  Teletext characters. All options auto-apply.
- Links and page numbers on Teletext (subtitle) pages are clickable
  as in Teletext windows.
- Subtitles have a context menu to disable them, reset size and
  position, open the preferences, override the character encoding of
  Teletext pages, and to select another subtitle language.
- Subtitles scale with the video, now with fixed character aspect
  unless the available space is too small.
- Subtitles can be dragged to a different size and position. The position
  automatically adjusts to keep all text visible. Size and position are
  remembered in the configuration, separately for windowed and
  fullscreen mode.
- Roll-up Closed Caption updates with each character received and
  rolls smoothly.
- The subtitle languages menu now uses radio menu items to indicate
  the current language.
- Users can override the character encoding of individual Teletext pages,
  this is remembered in the configuration per-channel data and affects
  Teletext browsing, subtitle display and recording, screenshots, and
  the subtitle language menus.
- In fullscreen mode subtitles no longer appear outside the video, if
  it is smaller than the screen for technical reasons, but can be
  dragged into the border.
- The screenshot plugin has an option to save the image with or without
  the displayed subtitles overlaid, with preview.
- The recording plugin permits recording of Closed Caption and Teletext
  subtitles as MPSub, QTText, RealText, SAMI, SubRip or SubViewer file,
  preserving text styles, justification and color if supported by the
  format.

Other improvements:

- The VBI device UI moved into the device section.  A new option has been
  added to select a DVB PES file as source (mainly for tests).  GnomeVFS
  is used to read compressed PES files.
- The Xawtv config import routines now handles baseband inputs
  (Debian bug/patch #302835).
- Zapping now has an entry at bugzilla.gnome.org. Hopefully the app will
  soon appear in bug-buddy menus to simplify bug reports.
- Bug-buddy metadata and a comment string was added to the zapping.desktop
  file.
- With GCC 4.0.1 compiling of SSE2 optimized functions is enabled (earlier
  versions had a bug aborting the compilation).
- New SSE3 optimized deinterlace routines were added.
- This version has preliminary support for the ivtv 0.2 and 0.3 driver
  (untested). So far display and screenshots only, no video out, recording
  or playback.

Fixes:

- A crash when clicking on the keyboard preferences "remove key" button.
- A bug in the VBI code aborting the app with an invalid fifo error.
- When the current video standard was selected from the standards menu
  Zapping closed the VBI device.

Dependencies:

- Zapping now requires libzvbi >= 0.2.11 for better DVB PES support
  (the most recent version is 0.2.16).


Zapping 0.9.6, 2005-07-14
-------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- Fullscreen-capture didn't work, giving a black screen.
- Changing the volume with the soundcard mixer didn't work right when
  the tv card has no volume controls, possibly with a crash at exit.

Zapping 0.9.5, 2005-07-07
-------------------------
Due to bugs in the original code major parts of the GreedyH
deinterlace method were disabled.  This code has been restored, all
options work now.

All deinterlace methods have been converted to vector intrinsics, with
MMX, 3DNow!, SSE and SSE2 optimized implementations, if supported by
the compiler.  (GCC 4.0 or 4.1 recommended.)  AltiVec and x86-64 SSE2
optimized implementations are available but have not been completely
tested yet.  The simpler deinterlace methods now have scalar
implementations which do not require a CPU with SIMD support.  An
extensive make check has been added.

Internal Changes:

- The volume and mute control hack switching between tv card and
  soundcard mixer has been replaced by a simpler and hopefully less
  error prone virtual control layer. 

Bug Fixes:

- Various fixes to compile with target x86-64.  All make checks passed but
  if/how Zapping as a whole works on x86-64 has not been tested yet.

- Various fixes to properly compile with older versions of GCC (tested
  3.2.3, 3.3.5, 3.4.4, 4.0 and 4.1 x86, 3.4.1 and 4.1 x86-64,
  partially with 3.4.3 powerpc).

- The VTX Teletext export function crashed.  Fixed by Mako the Goldfish.

- Teletext double width characters didn't display correctly.

- The --no-vbi command line option disables VBI only during the
  current session, doesn't stick anymore.

- Ioctl logging (--io-debug) didn't log the V4L2 ioctl VIDIOC_G/S_STD
  and OSS ioctls.

- Capture mode required more image buffers than some driver were able
  to provide.  This requirement has been relaxed, although it may
  disable some functions.

Packaging Changes:

- Users were confused when Zapping compiled successfully without
  libzvbi.  ./configure now fails if libzvbi is not installed.  To
  compile Zapping anyway the --without-zvbi option must be given.

- Previous versions installed files /etc/pam.d/zapping_setup_fb and
  /etc/security/console.apps/zapping_setup_fb.  Following GNU
  standards to permit non-root installs and make distcheck the
  /etc path has been replaced by $(sysconfdir) which defaults to
  $(prefix)/etc.  Root installation now requires ./configure
  --sysconfdir=/etc.

Zapping 0.9.4, 2005-04-21
-------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- PAL-Nc, PAL-M, PAL-N, NTSC-JP video standards were not offered when
  using v4l bttv driver.
- The TomsMoComp search effort option had no effect.
- The deinterlace plugin did not compile with gcc 3.3 or older
  (invalid parameter).

Zapping 0.9.3, 2005-04-05
-------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- Two deinterlace modules segfaulted when compiled with
  -fomit-frame-pointer option.
- The v4l driver interface did not timestamp images causing a
  synchronization failure in librte.
- An assert (c->dequeued == 0) failed when recording with the mp1e
  codec stopped.  This is a work-around for a bug also fixed in
  librte-0.5.6.
- Using the bktr driver, video input and channel changes were
  blocked in Teletext mode.
- Zapping did not properly restore the last video standard on
  startup.  Apparent with the bktr driver, possibly others.
- Zapping did not maintain the current video and audio input and
  video standard on capture mode changes.  Apparent with the
  bktr driver, possibly others.

Zapping 0.9.2, 2005-02-28
-------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- Zapping used to hang when recording was stopped. This is a
  preliminary fix, as a side effect Zapping cannot record and
  deinterlace at the same time.
- Various bugs were fixed in librte, used by the recording plugin.
- The zapping.schemas file was not localized and installed. (Christian)
- With active deinterlacing no display mode, capture mode, video input
  or video standard changes were possible. (SF #1145094)
- The error box appearing if capturing cannot be started did not
  contain a message. (SF #1145094)
- src/cpu.c did not compile on target powerpc due to missing #includes
  and -maltivec flag. (Christian)
- The manual pages did not install unless configure found xsltproc,
  the DocBook XML DTD and DocBook XSL Stylesheets. (Christian)

Zapping 0.9.1, 2005-02-20
-------------------------
Added French translation. Documentation and build fixes:

- help/C/settings.xml contained a stray & (&amp;). (Christian)
- The documentation contained &#nnn; entities not defined in xml.soc.
  Version numbers where outdated.
- The manual pages Makefile failed if configure did not find xsltproc,
  the DocBook XML DTD and DocBook XSL Stylesheets.
- zapping_setup_fb/v4l25.c did not compile on big endian targets.
  (Christian)

Zapping 0.9, 2005-02-15
-----------------------
This version of Zapping has a new deinterlace plugin based on code from
DScaler. Most of the changes since 0.8 went into related functions, for
example faster capture routines. For now deinterlacing works only with
V4L2 drivers on x86 CPUs with MMX. Zapping 0.9 should also work better
with webcams (needs testing), specifically those supported by the sn9c102
and pwc drivers. The screenshot plugin can grab images at full size as
opposed to video window size. The zapping_remote tool already present in
earlier version installs now, with a manual page. zapping_remote can be
used to send commands to a running Zapping process.

User visible bug fixes:
- Recognize Cyrix CPUs with MMX/SSE.
- Various fixes in the Teletext decoder.
- Correct XVideo (v4l) video input and standard names.
- Initially in the video input, audio input and standard menu the
  wrong item was active.
- Quitting by menu doesn't crash anymore.

Zapping 0.8, 2004-11-11
-----------------------
Main focus in Zapping 0.8 was on Teletext and VBI features.

Dependency changes:
- Zapping now requires libzvbi 0.2.9 or higher.
- The V4L2 0.20 API (predecessor of V4L2 in Linux 2.6) is no
  longer supported.

User visible changes:
- The page cache has been redesigned, it can now hold pages of
  multiple networks. No more delay to reload pages after a channel
  change. Offline browsing is possible, i.e. one can read pages of a
  different channel than the one currently received, a different
  channel in each Teletext window.
- The Teletext window has a new radio menu to change between networks
  in the cache, or to show pages of the currently received network.
- The Teletext decoding and formatting routines improved.
  The Teletext decoder will try hard to detect channel changes and
  identify channels, so multi-channel page caching also works properly
  on composite video input.
- The page cache used to store all received pages. It now has a
  user defined size limit. When the limit is reached the last recently
  used pages of the last recently used network are replaced, with
  higher priority give to frequently visited pages and subpages which
  often take longer to reload.
- TOP navigation has been redesigned. In addition to the navigation
  bar at the bottom of the page Teletext windows now have a TOP
  drop-down menu.
- In addition to the default character set region in preferences
  users can now completely override the character encoding of a page
  by choosing from a radio menu in Teletext windows.
- Zapzilla used to add a 41st black column to balance an often black
  first column. It now extends colors and graphics if the first
  column is not black.
- Rendering of blinking characters and the real time clock improved.
  Clock updates can be disabled in gconf-editor.
- When a requested page is not cached the page number in the header
  rolls to show the currently received pages. This can be disabled
  in gconf-editor.
- Cut & paste now speaks UTF-8.
- Teletext preferences have been redesigned along Gnome 2 human
  interface guidelines. Except for cache size all options apply
  immediately.
- The Teletext color dialog was merged into Teletext preferences.
- The page save dialog asks before overwriting an existing file.
  Error dialogs have been redesigned along Gnome 2 HIG.
- Zapping automatically leaves fullscreen mode to display help or
  an URL on a Teletext page, and error handling improved.
- Zapping now supports the new libzvbi proxy to share a VBI device
  with other applications such as the Nxtvepg EPG viewer.
- For tests (this will become a regular feature in future versions)
  Zapping can read Teletext, subtitle and caption data from a
  DVB MPEG stream (skipping video and audio, if any).
- The GConf interface improved to avoid problems we had in 0.7.

Zapping 0.7.3, 2004-10-11
-------------------------
Bug fixes.

Zapping 0.7.2, 2004-10-04
-------------------------
Zapping now supports fullscreen video capturing, including screenshots
and recording while in fullscreen mode, and fullscreen Teletext. Since
overlay limitations do not apply to captured video (if the graphics
card supports XVideo image scaling) the entire screen can be covered
by video. The context menu is now available in fullscreen mode.

A new background display mode has been added.

Teletext is now implemented as a plugin, slightly faster, with a
few minor GUI improvements. In the main window the menu and toolbar
can be disabled separately. Changing channels by mouse wheel should
work better and Zapping now properly disables the KDE 3.0 screensaver
(untested).

Dependency changes:
- This version of Zapping requires Gtk+ 2.4.

Important bug fixes:
- Zapping did not work with MSI TV-@nywhere (cx8800 based, using
  Linux 2.6 V4L2), this has been fixed and the driver interface
  generally improved.

Zapping 0.7.1, 2004-09-13
-------------------------
This time we have three major improvements: Zapping now runs on FreeBSD
using the bktr driver, missing only support for remote controls and
recording. Again it also runs on Solaris using XVideo, fixes courtesy
of Roger Fuji. Finally Xinerama is supported in all display modes.
In the minor improvements category the Teletext mode now shows a second
toolbar instead of squeezing more buttons into the primary toolbar.

Important bug fixes:
- Using V4L2 (Linux 2.6) there is now a working audio mode
  (mono, stereo, SAP) control.
- Position of subtitles in fullscreen mode was wrong.
- Alirc VOL_UP/DOWN did not work.

Zapping 0.7, 2004-07-09
-----------------------
Main focus in Zapping 0.7 was porting the user interface to Gnome 2. Along
with it numerous other improvements and fixes were made, including:

* Video:
  - In the video preferences, apart of "no change" and "automatic
    selection", users can now select a particular fullscreen
    resolution.
  - Fullscreen mode automatically recenters and hides the pointer.
  - The picture size menu in the video context menu is now editable,
    including accelerators (keyboard shortcuts).
  - The view menu now has a "keep window on top" option.
  - In the channel menu, the video input and video standard submenu
    are have "radio buttons" which show the current selection.
  - XVideo support was improved.

* Audio:
  - The entire audio code was rewritten from scratch to properly
    distinguish between sampling and mixer devices on the soundcard
    and tv card, and between recording and output volume.
  - Audio device preferences moved to a separate page in the preferences
    device section and are much clearer now. Usually users will not need
    to enter file names because available sampling and mixer devices are
    listed in menus by file name and device name.
  - Muting when Zapping terminates became optional.

* Teletext:
  - In Teletext mode the main window toolbar has a new button to return
    to video mode, besides the button to overlay the current page as
    subtitles.
  - Teletext windows now have a menu.
  - The history buttons didn't work quite right, do now.
  - The search dialog is simpler now, no longer modal (blocking other
    windows).
  - The save format menu moved from the context menu into the dialog.
  - We have a new Gnome 2 style bookmark editing dialog.

* Caption / Subtitles:
  - The toolbar now has a toggle button to enable caption / subtitles,
    connected to the subtitle check menu item in the View menu. Users
    can also enable and disable subtitles from the video context menu.
  - The subtitle page number entry was removed from VBI preferences.
    Zapping automatically determines the right CC stream or Teletext
    page if the network transmits this information, and remembers the
    last source selected by the user on each channel.
  - Subtitles can be selected by CC stream, Teletext page number or
    language from the video context menu, and by activating Teletext
    mode, choosing a page and clicking on the subtitle button.

* Electronic Program Guide:
  - Zapping now interoperates with Nxtevpg. For details see
    http://zapping.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/view/Main/ZappingHelp

* Channel Editor:
  - Frequency tables are now sorted by country rather than geographical
    regions. Zapping attempts to preselect the country from system
    preferences.
  - Automatic station search improved.
  - Zapping can import the channel table, along with a few per-channel
    settings, from a XawTV configuration file ~/.xawtv.
  - The dialog now has a button to add a new channel and the GUI behaves
    more logical.

* Screenshot Plugin:
  - Preview is now obligatory.
  - Pressing the enter key in the screenshot dialog filename entry
    saves the picture and closes the dialog. This is normal Gnome
    behaviour and no longer optional.
  - The directory for screenshots entry was removed from screenshot
    preferences. Zapping now remembers the last path entered in the
    dialog.
  - When pictures are saved without dialog Zapping automatically
    replaces the filename extension, appends an ascending number to the
    last used filename if such a file already exists, and automatically
    creates all non-existing directories in the path.

* Command Line:
  - zapping_setup_fb is no longer called at startup but only if needed.
    For safety Zapping double verfies the overlay initialization.
  - The zapping_remote tool is available to send commands to a running
    Zapping process. Zapping and zapping_remote are partially compatible
    to Xawtv and xawtv-remote.
  - Zapping has new command line options: --xv-video-port,
    --xv-image-port, --no-xv-video, --no-xv-image, --no-overlay for fine
    grained XVideo and video overlay control (mostly for debugging,
    this stuff really belongs into device preferences). --io-debug
    enables logging of all driver programming.

* Documentation:
  - Zapping now has proper online help available from the Help menu.
  - Help buttons in various dialogs now open the respective section of
    the Zapping documentation in the Gnome help browser.

* Miscellaneous:
  - Zapping commands at the command line, for keyboard customization,
    for remote control programming with the ALIRC plugin and commands
    sent to a Zapping process with the new zapping_remote tool have been
    unified. We use a real scripting language now, Python. Legacy commands
    are still supported for compatibility.
  - All Zapping toolbars have a context menu to change their appearance.
    The same menu is available in the window preferences.
  - In keyboard preferences accelerators can be entered directly in the
    table by double-clicking on a key cell.
  - Zapping has an experimental VDR interface, will need more work in
    the future.
  - The LIRC plugin was removed from this release. Plan is to combine
    the best features of LIRC and ALIRC plugin in a future remote
    control plugin.
  - The program and network info dialogs were removed. If and how they
    will return is undetermined.
  - VBI triggers were removed from this release for a rewrite.

For details see the ChangeLog file.

This release was possible with the help of the following people:
Guus Bonnema, IÒaki Etxebarria, Henrik Isacsson, Christian Marillat,
Morten Brix Pedersen, Pino Toscano. Many thanks to you and everyone
submitting ideas, patches and bug reports.

0.6.8
-----
Overlay fix and an Italian translation update.

0.6.7
-----
Fixes a bug in the screenshot plugin, crashing Zapping on exit,
and triggered by the nptl library on RedHat 9. In the RPM it
was unavoidable to require newer versions of libc and libpng.

0.6.6
-----
Hi folks. Following the last Gnome 1 release of Zapping I'm proud
to announce the actual last version. Let's hope 0.7 will be ready
before we need some more last versions.

This version fixes a number of bugs in the previous version,
most notably recording and mute/volume problems.

The V4L2 interface of Linux 2.5 is now supported, new commands
were added to the alirc plugin: MUTE, VOL_UP, VOL_DOWN,
and the SETCHANNEL function improved. The --remote command line
option can be used to disable overlay. Pino Toscano kindly
contributed an Italian translation.

0.6.5
-----
It's been a long time since 0.6.4, much too long, but finally
the beast arrived. Main change this time is the switch from rte 0.4 to
0.5, our high speed audio/video recording library. The recording plugin
will not work with rte 0.4 unless you compile Zapping yourself.

rte 0.5 adds a lot more formats besides MPEG-1 using ffmpeg and divx4linux,
possibly even more in the future. Along with the new codecs comes a new
recording dialog which allows users to save recording configurations
under different names.

RPM changes:
- Some earlier Zapping binaries installed in /usr/local, the default
  when building the application from source. The current binary
  zapping-0.6.5-1.i386.rpm installs in /usr which should integrate better
  in most Linux distributions, including RedHat and Mandrake. The rte
  and zvbi packages always installed in /usr.
- Another binary zapping-0.6.5-1.suse.i386.rpm is provided which
  installs in /opt/gnome, otherwise identical.

Other changes:
- We have new GUI options to change the toolbar style and keep the video
  window on top (when supported by the window manager).
- Zapping temporarily disables XScreensaver, the software screen blanker
  by J. Zawinski. Of course the X11 built-in savers are also disabled.
- Teletext export options and the record plugin codec menus where not
  or not correctly localized in the past (i.e. remaining in English).
  For full satisfaction you may have to update zvbi as well.
- Thanks to Guus Bonnema for taking over maintenance of the orphaned
  Dutch translation.
- Matt without last name contributed a frequency table for Canadian cable.
- Well, and the usual set of fixes, non-fixes and micro improvements.

This is the last release of Zapping (gasp!) using Gnome 1 (phew!). The
next version 0.7 will require Gnome 2, so please stop asking now. If you
like to live on the bleeding edge, the tree is in CVS, branch
zapping-gnome2. It will move to the HEAD trunk at the appropriate time.

0.6.4
-----
This is mostly a bugfix release, no new features. When you
use this version you should also install zvbi 0.1.1 which
adds more fixes.

0.6.3
-----
A new year, a new release, a new maintainer. Sadly this
release does not include all improvements planned for 0.6.3,
but it's over three months since the last release, without an
end in sight. Future versions will be released at shorter
intervals.

The main difference to 0.6.2 is the extraction of the Zapping vbi
decoder into a separate package "zvbi". Motivation was to clean
up and re-use the component in other applications, encourage more
frequent updates and to reduce the size of binaries. Zapping can
be compiled without, but a lot of functionality depends on the
zvbi library, so you should really get it. Using the binary
packages makes it a requirement.

Other changes:
- Recording source and volume can be selected in preferences.
  Currently only the OSS /dev/mixer is supported.
- For our US and Canadian users Zapping now looks for XDS
  program title, start and end times, rating etc. and can
  display this information in the title bar or a program
  info window.
- Complete rewrite of the screenshot plugin. Better dialog,
  supports JPEG and PPM (possibly more, inquire within), has
  quality preview and on-the-fly deinterlacing.
- Some channel editor improvements.
- The "snapshot button" present on ov511 web cams is scanned
  and does what it's supposed to.
- Pointer disappears and reappears screen-saver style.
- Some Teletext export improvements.
- New mute audio toolbar button.
- Channel numbers can be entered on the numeric keypad, either
  by channel memory number (European style) or RF channel
  number (US style).
- Preliminary volume up/down function.
- Most of the keybord shortcuts are configurable now.
- And the usual set of bug fixes and new bugs.

0.6.2
-----
- Dutch translation.
- Redesigned channel editor and properties dialog.
- SGML renderer for OSD.
- In-window OSD, no more floating subtitle windows.
- Support for the Logitech Quickcam Express (possibly
  other quickcams too, but this is untested).
- Improved timestamping.
- ARTS recording support.
- Sync with rte 0.4
- Bugfixes and polishment, as usual.

0.6.1 
-----
- Added Swedish translation.
- Reported to build and work (using XVideo) under FreeBSD and Solaris.
- Automatic overlaying of subtitle TTX pages.
- Reverted to the old fb depth detection routine.
- Some bugfixes in the mpeg plugin, adapted to use rte 0.3.1's new controls api.
- Fixed some bugs with Arabic and Hebrew TTX glyph mapping.
- Usability improvements, especially in the channel editor.
- Updated de, es, fr and pl translations.
