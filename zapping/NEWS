New stuff, refer to the ChangeLog for a more detailed description of
the changes.

0.7.1
-----
Zapping now runs on FreeBSD using the bktr driver, missing only support
for remote controls and recording. Again it also runs on Solaris using
XVideo, fixes courtesy of Roger Fuji.

Important bug fixes:
- Using V4L2 (Linux 2.6) there is now a working audio mode
  (mono, stereo, SAP) control.
- Position of subtitles in fullscreen mode was wrong.
- Alirc VOL_UP/DOWN did not work.

0.7
---
Main focus in Zapping 0.7 was porting the user interface to Gnome 2. Along
with it numerous other improvements and fixes were made, including:

* Video:
  - In the video preferences, apart of "no change" and "automatic
    selection", users can now select a particular fullscreen
    resolution.
  - Fullscreen mode automatically recenters and hides the pointer.
  - The picture size menu in the video context menu is now editable,
    including accelerators (keyboard shortcuts).
  - The view menu now has a "keep window on top" option.
  - In the channel menu, the video input and video standard submenu
    are have "radio buttons" which show the current selection.
  - XVideo support was improved.

* Audio:
  - The entire audio code was rewritten from scratch to properly
    distinguish between sampling and mixer devices on the soundcard
    and tv card, and between recording and output volume.
  - Audio device preferences moved to a separate page in the preferences
    device section and are much clearer now. Usually users will not need
    to enter file names because available sampling and mixer devices are
    listed in menus by file name and device name.
  - Muting when Zapping terminates became optional.

* Teletext:
  - In Teletext mode the main window toolbar has a new button to return
    to video mode, besides the button to overlay the current page as
    subtitles.
  - Teletext windows now have a menu.
  - The history buttons didn't work quite right, do now.
  - The search dialog is simpler now, no longer modal (blocking other
    windows).
  - The save format menu moved from the context menu into the dialog.
  - We have a new Gnome 2 style bookmark editing dialog.

* Caption / Subtitles:
  - The toolbar now has a toggle button to enable caption / subtitles,
    connected to the subtitle check menu item in the View menu. Users
    can also enable and disable subtitles from the video context menu.
  - The subtitle page number entry was removed from VBI preferences.
    Zapping automatically determines the right CC stream or Teletext
    page if the network transmits this information, and remembers the
    last source selected by the user on each channel.
  - Subtitles can be selected by CC stream, Teletext page number or
    language from the video context menu, and by activating Teletext
    mode, choosing a page and clicking on the subtitle button.

* Electronic Program Guide:
  - Zapping now interoperates with Nxtevpg. For details see
    http://zapping.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/view/Main/ZappingHelp

* Channel Editor:
  - Frequency tables are now sorted by country rather than geographical
    regions. Zapping attempts to preselect the country from system
    preferences.
  - Automatic station search improved.
  - Zapping can import the channel table, along with a few per-channel
    settings, from a XawTV configuration file ~/.xawtv.
  - The dialog now has a button to add a new channel and the GUI behaves
    more logical.

* Screenshot Plugin:
  - Preview is now obligatory.
  - Pressing the enter key in the screenshot dialog filename entry
    saves the picture and closes the dialog. This is normal Gnome
    behaviour and no longer optional.
  - The directory for screenshots entry was removed from screenshot
    preferences. Zapping now remembers the last path entered in the
    dialog.
  - When pictures are saved without dialog Zapping automatically
    replaces the filename extension, appends an ascending number to the
    last used filename if such a file already exists, and automatically
    creates all non-existing directories in the path.

* Command Line:
  - zapping_setup_fb is no longer called at startup but only if needed.
    For safety Zapping double verfies the overlay initialization.
  - The zapping_remote tool is available to send commands to a running
    Zapping process. Zapping and zapping_remote are partially compatible
    to Xawtv and xawtv-remote.
  - Zapping has new command line options: --xv-video-port,
    --xv-image-port, --no-xv-video, --no-xv-image, --no-overlay for fine
    grained XVideo and video overlay control (mostly for debugging,
    this stuff really belongs into device preferences). --io-debug
    enables logging of all driver programming.

* Documentation:
  - Zapping now has proper online help available from the Help menu.
  - Help buttons in various dialogs now open the respective section of
    the Zapping documentation in the Gnome help browser.

* Miscellaneous:
  - Zapping commands at the command line, for keyboard customization,
    for remote control programming with the ALIRC plugin and commands
    sent to a Zapping process with the new zapping_remote tool have been
    unified. We use a real scripting language now, Python. Legacy commands
    are still supported for compatibility.
  - All Zapping toolbars have a context menu to change their appearance.
    The same menu is available in the window preferences.
  - In keyboard preferences accelerators can be entered directly in the
    table by double-clicking on a key cell.
  - Zapping has an experimental VDR interface, will need more work in
    the future.
  - The LIRC plugin was removed from this release. Plan is to combine
    the best features of LIRC and ALIRC plugin in a future remote
    control plugin.
  - The program and network info dialogs were removed. If and how they
    will return is undetermined.
  - VBI triggers were removed from this release for a rewrite.

For details see the ChangeLog file.

This release was possible with the help of the following people:
Guus Bonnema, Iñaki Etxebarria, Henrik Isacsson, Christian Marillat,
Morten Brix Pedersen, Pino Toscano. Many thanks to you and everyone
submitting ideas, patches and bug reports.

0.6.8
-----
Overlay fix and an Italian translation update.

0.6.7
-----
Fixes a bug in the screenshot plugin, crashing Zapping on exit,
and triggered by the nptl library on RedHat 9. In the RPM it
was unavoidable to require newer versions of libc and libpng.

0.6.6
-----
Hi folks. Following the last Gnome 1 release of Zapping I'm proud
to announce the actual last version. Let's hope 0.7 will be ready
before we need some more last versions.

This version fixes a number of bugs in the previous version,
most notably recording and mute/volume problems.

The V4L2 interface of Linux 2.5 is now supported, new commands
were added to the alirc plugin: MUTE, VOL_UP, VOL_DOWN,
and the SETCHANNEL function improved. The --remote command line
option can be used to disable overlay. Pino Toscano kindly
contributed an Italian translation.

0.6.5
-----
It's been a long time since 0.6.4, much too long, but finally
the beast arrived. Main change this time is the switch from rte 0.4 to
0.5, our high speed audio/video recording library. The recording plugin
will not work with rte 0.4 unless you compile Zapping yourself.

rte 0.5 adds a lot more formats besides MPEG-1 using ffmpeg and divx4linux,
possibly even more in the future. Along with the new codecs comes a new
recording dialog which allows users to save recording configurations
under different names.

RPM changes:
- Some earlier Zapping binaries installed in /usr/local, the default
  when building the application from source. The current binary
  zapping-0.6.5-1.i386.rpm installs in /usr which should integrate better
  in most Linux distributions, including RedHat and Mandrake. The rte
  and zvbi packages always installed in /usr.
- Another binary zapping-0.6.5-1.suse.i386.rpm is provided which
  installs in /opt/gnome, otherwise identical.

Other changes:
- We have new GUI options to change the toolbar style and keep the video
  window on top (when supported by the window manager).
- Zapping temporarily disables XScreensaver, the software screen blanker
  by J. Zawinski. Of course the X11 built-in savers are also disabled.
- Teletext export options and the record plugin codec menus where not
  or not correctly localized in the past (i.e. remaining in English).
  For full satisfaction you may have to update zvbi as well.
- Thanks to Guus Bonnema for taking over maintenance of the orphaned
  Dutch translation.
- Matt without last name contributed a frequency table for Canadian cable.
- Well, and the usual set of fixes, non-fixes and micro improvements.

This is the last release of Zapping (gasp!) using Gnome 1 (phew!). The
next version 0.7 will require Gnome 2, so please stop asking now. If you
like to live on the bleeding edge, the tree is in CVS, branch
zapping-gnome2. It will move to the HEAD trunk at the appropriate time.

0.6.4
-----
This is mostly a bugfix release, no new features. When you
use this version you should also install zvbi 0.1.1 which
adds more fixes.

0.6.3
-----
A new year, a new release, a new maintainer. Sadly this
release does not include all improvements planned for 0.6.3,
but it's over three months since the last release, without an
end in sight. Future versions will be released at shorter
intervals.

The main difference to 0.6.2 is the extraction of the Zapping vbi
decoder into a separate package "zvbi". Motivation was to clean
up and re-use the component in other applications, encourage more
frequent updates and to reduce the size of binaries. Zapping can
be compiled without, but a lot of functionality depends on the
zvbi library, so you should really get it. Using the binary
packages makes it a requirement.

Other changes:
- Recording source and volume can be selected in preferences.
  Currently only the OSS /dev/mixer is supported.
- For our US and Canadian users Zapping now looks for XDS
  program title, start and end times, rating etc. and can
  display this information in the title bar or a program
  info window.
- Complete rewrite of the screenshot plugin. Better dialog,
  supports JPEG and PPM (possibly more, inquire within), has
  quality preview and on-the-fly deinterlacing.
- Some channel editor improvements.
- The "snapshot button" present on ov511 web cams is scanned
  and does what it's supposed to.
- Pointer disappears and reappears screen-saver style.
- Some Teletext export improvements.
- New mute audio toolbar button.
- Channel numbers can be entered on the numeric keypad, either
  by channel memory number (European style) or RF channel
  number (US style).
- Preliminary volume up/down function.
- Most of the keybord shortcuts are configurable now.
- And the usual set of bug fixes and new bugs.

0.6.2
-----
- Dutch translation.
- Redesigned channel editor and properties dialog.
- SGML renderer for OSD.
- In-window OSD, no more floating subtitle windows.
- Support for the Logitech Quickcam Express (possibly
  other quickcams too, but this is untested).
- Improved timestamping.
- ARTS recording support.
- Sync with rte 0.4
- Bugfixes and polishment, as usual.

0.6.1 
-----
- Added Swedish translation.
- Reported to build and work (using XVideo) under FreeBSD and Solaris.
- Automatic overlaying of subtitle TTX pages.
- Reverted to the old fb depth detection routine.
- Some bugfixes in the mpeg plugin, adapted to use rte 0.3.1's new controls api.
